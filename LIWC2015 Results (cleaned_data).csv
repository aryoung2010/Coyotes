I got the courage one time to try and make plans, since he said he wanted to, but he blew me off for her and said ""he had to clean the house"" but instead his girlfriend, aka my friend posted a picture on instagram about it, and made me feel like I was being targeted by her. She knew she had something I wanted and could never have, and would rub it in my face when ever she could, always bringing him up in conversations and reading their texts off to me, even when I told her to stop and after awhile I had to hang up. When ever we had a bond, she would find a way to break it, like with watching supernatural, it was our thing, and he had no other friends who watched it, granted we both only started a couple of days ago, and she had to find her way in to our thing and be the little petty thing she is and break our bond and find a way that we all had to share it, which having to share it and being a third wheel isn't already bad enough in general. But honestly the one thing we had In common she had to break it, just to shove it in my face, that she has him, and not me. I honestly just want to cry, and curl up in a ball. I am humiliated, that I am just letting her do this, but Betrayed like every other time she runs in rubs it in my face. After it's happened for awhile, I told him what was happening, since he makes me feel comfortable, and I just stopped being friends with her, I still advoid her as much as possible, but it pains me that when I do see her, I still can't get her to stop                                                                                                          ",345,12.62,70.92,34.14,25.77,43.12,9.57,95.36,67.54,27.83,19.71,8.41,2.03,0.00,8.99,0.29,8.12,3.19,13.91,9.57,6.67,7.83,1.74,20.29,2.90,2.61,2.32,0.87,1.74,4.06,2.03,2.03,0.58,0.58,0.29,16.81,0.00,2.32,5.51,3.77,12.17,1.74,1.74,2.03,0.87,2.61,3.19,3.19,1.16,0.58,1.45,1.16,0.87,0.29,0.00,0.00,9.28,5.51,0.87,1.45,0.87,1.16,9.57,8.70,0.29,16.23,1.16,5.80,8.12,0.00,0.58,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.46,2.03,8.70,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.58,0.87,0.00,0.29
7,710,,squarespace,,,,,,Female,no,NA,,NA,,,,relationships,"                                  Okay, so a while ago I had this completely toxic friendship, and it took me months to get out of it. But what if didn’t realize until the very end was what it was doing to me. This girl who was my “friend” decided to form a relationship with a guy (its always a guy huh?). Anyways my other friend and I (this was a trio friendship) started getting these weird feelings about this guy, and not the mushy gushy stuff, like we wanted our friend to drop him and run for the hills. I started getting panic attacks around him, and felt like I could breath when his name was mentioned (weird right?). Well soon enough we confronted our friend after she broke up with him (don’t do that it never goes well). She was alll nice and accepting of our criticism, but the next day she took our feelings we shared, ground them up into a much smoldering cup of coffee, and splashed them back at us. Of course she got back with the guy which ended up tearing our friendship apart because I was wary of him and warned her. After telling her about my anxiety around him, here is the grand punch line fellow humans, she suggested that I hang out with him more. Yep she wanted me to “get over” these aniexty attacks and force myself to be happy and hang out with him. Basically she wanted me to for form a friendship with him, of course I said no because...you know self preservation, and I told her that he was he cause of the tension in our friend ship and we decided that we just were not good for each other, and split ways. So that is the story of me being pressured into a relationship (the friendship kind) with my best friends boyfriend who ended up causing our toxic friendship to become non-existing. Lol, thanks weird boyfriend for opening my eyes to his toxic this friendship was ??

Like I mean to the point where I would ask my mom if I could just stay home. But I was at this new school and I was doing so good with my grades and everything that I knew she wouldn’t let me. About a month ago I started dating this guy. He was sweet he knew just what to say to get my full on attention. Little did he know that that’s how the last guy kept me for 10 months. So I knew the game he was playing. He would break up with me and then comeback he would threaten to break up with and so on and so on. So it got to where I was done with his crap and broke up with him myself. So I used the short little time I had to get closer to some of my friends. Well one of my friends decided to go behind my back and tell the other girl me and her ex were talking. Instead of texting me, she texted him and said she was pregnant with his child. He called me when he found out. I put the little puzzle together only too learn they haven’t been together since April, he’s still a virgin. Then the girl that went behind my back contacted him again and told him I had a bf. So of course he texted me and asked just to make sure I didn’t. So I told him no and anytime he wanted to go through my phone he could. So July 3, 2018 he went to a doctors appointment with me and my mom. Infront of him I was diagnosed with TOS (kind of a long definition, but it’s where the nerves and arteries are being compressed so it’s causing tons of pain in my shoulders and up through my neck). I told him he didn’t have to stick around. He said that he would stick around even if it meant surgery. I’m thankful I have a mature guy. But I wish people had the guts to say stuff to my face.

21,2113,,squarespace,,,,no,,female,yes,17,,NA,,6065166771,,bullying,"    My freshman year of high school, I quickly fell into the wrong crowd. I became involved a group of guys I most certainly should not have. I had a huge crush on this one so I started talking to him more and we were basically in a relationship, then he went for a girl I used to be friends with, so he tried to set me up with one of his friends. Well. His friend and I hit it off really well until the first guy decided I was what he wanted! He told me not to tell his friend and to basically just ghost him: he said not to text, call, FaceTime, Snapchat, or talk to him in any way. I didn’t know what to do because I know what it’s like to be ghosted, I didn’t want to do that to somebody.. so I asked the first guy what I should do if he messages me and he told me “Just ignore him.

Finally I had it, after continuous texts and calls I had to ignore, I couldn’t handle what I was doing to this guys so called “best friend” so I FaceTimed him and told him everything. Then all three of us got in this huge fight, the first guy even told me he “wasn’t losing his best friend of some stupid girl.” When it was his fault we were in that position!!! AND the first guy blames me for us not being together now. But even to this day, 3 years later, they both tell everyone I had sex with both of them and that we even had a threesome. I’ve confronted them about it, but they say they never have said anything like that. We all have the same social group still and everybody thinks I’ve slept with them both, separately and together!

Eventually, a few girls came up to me and brought me to guidance to get me some help before everything got worse. Luckily, the whole situation died down and everyone forgot about it. But I am still upset that the kid wanted to hide the fact that he wasn’t straight because he had to hide from me FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

44,4413,,squarespace,,,,no,,female,yes,13,,NA,,,,bullying,"      So there was this girl that has the same name as me. we used to not be close but then i introduced her to my friend group and then we were all really great friends. sure, we had arguments and stuff like everyone else and what she did came out of the blue. Our highschool basketball team was going to state, and we had a community pep rally the night before. All of my friends decided to stay after school in a teachers room to work on homework before the rally. The girl invited us to go to her house so i agreed, but then later just felt like going home so i told her nevermind. We sat next to each other during the pep rally and I thought everything was okay. Later, when i got home i went to our friend grouchat on snapchat to ask them something. Then the girl starts calling me a bitch and i laughed and said wow that was an insult thanks and i brushed it off. Little did I know she would go on her friends account to write this nasty paragraph saying how nobody likes me and how im a hoe and how i am extra and how everyone talks behind my back. i was shocked and of course the whole group chat started arguing back and forth saying nasty rude things to each other. i got really depressed and suicidal. at lunch we got in a bad argument, and i started crying because i was so mad. i asked to go home, but they told me to talk to the principal, which i did. he then talked to her and then she set up this meeting thing to tell me she ‘was sorry and it was because of problems with her family’ i didn’t exactly forgive her nor talk to her for the next few months. but because we have friends that are friends with each other we are always near each other. i can tell she wants to be friends again, but honestly why would i when i feel like she is just going to do the same thing over again? now we are okay, but i just don’t talk to her. that whole scenario definitely changed me and made me feel a little more stronger because that was one of the worst things that have happened to me. although i wasn’t happy, i got over it the right way.

45,4513,,squarespace,,,,yellow,,female,yes,13,,NA,,9195979705,,bullying,"      I had found out that a boy at school liked me and at first I was very flattered. I didn’t like him back but it feels nice to know that somebody likes you. Kind of like a confidence booster. But then things got WIERD. The boy kept saying things non stop such as “you smell good” or “you’re beautiful”. But then things changed from weird to SCARY! He started drawing pictures of me in all of his classes and behind my back. Not only pictures of me but pictures of my in a BIKINI! Things calmed down for about a week until he approached me after school and said “Hey, well there are rumors going around that you are gay, and well... is it true?” I started to FREAK OUT. I panicked. Maybe he will stay away from me if I just say yes. So that is what I did. And then he said... “no, I’m pretty sure you’re lying, you’re not gay!” WHAT THE HECK! WHO WOULD SAY THAT! A week later he asked me out even though it was clear that I was going to say no. He kept on drawing pictures of me and then sending me love letters. And then believe it or not... IT GOT WORSE! He told his friends that we were dating when WE WERE NOT! And he and his friends said things to me like “wear tights and booty shorts more often” or when I bent over to pick up a pencil they would shout “bend over girl!” By now this boy was following me everywhere and stalking me and threatened that his friend would RAPE me because I wouldn’t go out with him. He wouldn’t stop until finally I told the teacher and the principal. And the worst part was that when I told my “friends” some of them would say “I think you’re giving him a hard time” or “I think he’s being sweet by trying so hard” or “you’re lying” even “just go out with him.” But the truth that I hope everybody learns from this story is that harassment is terrifying and NEVER okay. The moment that you harass someone or that someone harassed you, a life will be changed. So try and do your part. #STANDUPTOTHEHARASSERS                                                                                                       ",378,7.96,70.18,64.82,50.46,12.19,11.38,96.83,65.34,25.40,16.93,8.20,0.53,2.91,4.76,0.53,8.47,3.97,11.64,8.99,7.14,11.64,2.65,20.63,4.76,2.12,1.59,0.26,1.32,8.73,5.03,3.70,1.06,1.85,0.00,17.99,0.00,1.06,0.26,5.56,14.55,1.85,1.06,2.12,4.76,2.38,4.76,5.29,1.59,2.38,0.79,2.12,0.53,0.26,0.79,0.26,7.14,2.12,1.06,2.12,1.32,1.32,7.41,9.26,2.65,15.34,2.65,6.08,7.41,1.59,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.85,0.53,0.00,0.53,0.53,0.00,19.84,7.14,1.32,0.00,0.00,0.26,2.12,0.00,5.82,2.91,0.00,0.26

47,4713,,squarespace,,,,yellow,,male,yes,17,,28278,,7048074583,,bullying,"      Hey, I’m Jaime. I’m 17 and my life has been a total mess. I’m a son to an immigrant mother living within the U.S. to help make a difference in the world. She can’t speak English, well sort of, but overall I’m her right hand man. Me and her are one and the same. She worries about me and I worry about her. I have four other siblings including two girls and two boys. I have an oldest sibling being a girl who has honestly caused a reckoning in my family. You see my mom made a hard decision when she was younger at around the age of 17-18. She decided to leave my oldest sister in Honduras knowing that the passage to America wasn’t safe. She didn’t want to jeopardize losing my sister to gangs or anything of the sort when coming to America. If most of you don’t know Honduras is a very violent country with gangs that rape and mistreat people. Police can be bribed and literally are the worst if not careful. Well, my mother was brought by my sister biological dad. Her dad mistreated my mother and my mother has overcome all the battles that came her way. Oh, and back to my mom leaving my sister. She just didn’t leave her with no one, she left her with my grandma. My grandma had a special bond with my sister because while my mom was pregnant with her so was my grandma. I know right? Crazy! But yeah, they both gave birth at the same time. Unfortunately my grandma lost her baby and my sister arrived safely. So, I guess my Grandma had a special connection with my sister. My mom left her at age 1. If you don’t already know... the one reason most people come from other countries to America; is to provide a steady flow of income to help provide food, clothing, and money to their families back home. And/or to the families they have with them in the United States.So, to all you descendants to hard working immigrant parents. I sincerely applaud your parents and you for withstanding all these challenges. I know I’m not the only one with a story and I know we can overcome it.  My moms story continues on within the years of course and literally I can write a whole book. But you maybe asking where “They we’re talking about me...” topic goes into play. Well... I’ve been talked about or mentioned my whole life. I’ve had enemies which include friends, family, and acquaintances that have spoke badly behind my back. By calling me gay, fat, stupid, judging me by my voice, my skin tone by being brown and not white. But I overcomes all of it by focusing on school. I currently attend a Middle College so when I graduate I receive my high school diploma with also receiving a Associates in Arts. As I grew up and turned a year older since 2001. I have cried my soul out. I’ve overcomed the gossip and mistreatment. I’m a Capricorn. I’ve come out as bi sexual but having a strong liking into men than female. But the. I’d consider myself pansexual. I’ve gotten a cartilage piercing and have change my style to where I get a diffeeent type of gossip. And I have learned to absorb the hate. I have more to tell. But for now I’d say to you guys reading this, to block out the hate and follow you’re dreams. Study what you’re going to like to work in the future. Don’t let others harm you... be a badass to where your success reflects and shuts up the haters. It can be in ways in school like getting good grades, or changing your style to what you like. Little things make a big difference.  And if you do find yourself being suffocated into a black hole. Find someone to talk too and pour your soul out, I promise you’ll feel better. I know there’s a god up there in heaven that watches over us and loves everyone know matter what they classify as. He loves us. I love you. There’s always someone with you that loves you. I'll be back...to be continued. - J.I.M Jr.                                                                                                       ",715,40.76,71.68,79.82,32.99,11.53,14.97,92.31,56.08,20.14,16.78,9.93,0.56,2.94,2.52,0.84,3.36,6.29,12.73,8.95,4.62,7.55,1.54,17.34,4.76,2.66,1.54,1.68,1.54,6.29,3.36,2.94,0.28,1.12,0.42,17.76,4.76,0.70,5.73,1.12,10.07,2.38,1.26,0.70,2.52,1.12,3.92,1.96,0.70,0.56,0.70,2.38,0.42,0.70,0.70,0.28,8.67,4.34,1.40,2.10,0.84,0.70,4.06,13.15,0.70,13.01,2.80,7.13,3.92,2.80,1.12,0.70,0.28,0.56,0.00,1.12,0.14,0.00,0.14,0.56,0.00,18.32,10.63,2.80,0.00,0.14,0.14,0.14,0.28,0.28,3.78,0.00,0.14

So I just sat in the car for a bit, then he came out to my car and asked if I was okay. I said yes, not wanting him to worry. So he got in the car and said “I know something that will make you feel better.” He pulled me on top of him and started to kiss me. That was my first kiss, and it felt absolutely weird. I didn’t like it, I mean I could stand it and it wasn’t unbearable, but I felt absolutely nothing. He said “so I don’t know my boundaries with you” and I said “all clothes on, that’s my only request.” He started kissing me on my neck and chest and I felt nothing at all. I said I felt sick and wanted to go home... once I got home, I knew I made a terrible mistake. I don’t even know why I let him do that, and it was just an overall terrible experience. I started to talk to other people about it, and they suggested maybe I didn’t like him or maybe he wasn’t right for me. Those suggestions did not feel right at all. Then I started thinking about the moment in my car and it all clicked. My mind was spinning from the facts that had recently been realized. I only watch the female during a kissing scene in tv shows, I asked my mom when I was like 10 if I could marry girls or if it had to be just boys. I also even fangirled over all the badass girl superheroines, instead of liking Superman and Batman and Captain America like my friends and mom did. I also didn’t like Jensen Ackles or Jared Padalecki in Supernatural, but instead loved the girl who played Charlie. After this realization, I started watching YouTube videos with gay people in them and also watching supergirl. (I know, I’m such a cliche haha.) I’ve recently noticed everything my mind was scared to before. The only problem was that everyone was talking about me. How I’m such a heartbreaker and that I don’t deserve to have anyone because I’d just hurt them even more than I did with the boy. They were talking about how I’m a slut and only use people to be sexual. They made my life hell for at least a month... I want so badly to tell them “I’m like so gay dude...” like KStew said on SNL, but I just can’t. Not yet.

My boyfriend is having trust issues now because he lives 12 hours away. Everyone but me were telling him that I wanted it and that I remembered all of it. But the truth is I don’t remember anything about the assault and I did not want to be touched by him. I guess ts hard to believe one person over five people. My boyfriend has decided to believe me and stay with me but he is keeping his guard up. Which kind of sucks. But now to most people I’m a cheating whore who is just embarrassed for doing such a thing.

I’ve wanted to go back to one school as it has people that I consider my real friends at it. For three years out of my high school life, I’ve hung around people I barely even know, and call them my friends. One friend, I’ll call him Harry, has been the only one I’ve talked to at this new school I’m currently going to for my junior year. He’s made fat jokes, gay jokes, and everything in between, but that’s just how we joked around. At least I thought that was what it was. After the end of the first semester he started to change for the worst. I realized he was trying to fight me and get his friends to stop liking me or even talking to me. I still messed with him every morning of our guitar class, but one day I did the thing where you tip someone’s hat off and he straight up punched me in the face and called me worthless. The only friend I had turned on me. I started getting way more depressed and sad after school. I stopped talking to my long distance girlfriend as much, I stopped talking to anyone, including my parents, and Harry just kept fucking pushing, punching, and talking shit about me. I just felt alone. There seemed to be no one to turn to and no one to talk to.

(This will be a bit controversial). My second period teacher said out loud, “Whoever walks out will get ISS.” I wasn’t going to put up with him because he clearly had biases to the students he viewed as “His own” (aka those brats who plays sports and were rich). My friends (there were three of them) did not want to walkout due to the fact that they want a perfect record, but I told them to not worry. They cannot give us ISS or a severe punishment. I was the only person in that class to walkout, which is okay because one person can make a difference. Without my knowledge, my teacher took attendance at the time of the walkout, which is unethical and stupid as a teacher.

Every time I bring my boyfriend home to eat dinner with us, watch a movie with me, or just hang out, he tells us both that our relationship isn’t real simply because it’s two males. While on the other hand, my little brother is trans and gay, and my dad believes all of his relationships are valid because he has a vagina. Whenever I ask him about it, he claims that a “real man” will teach his “daughter” to be girlier, and if I would just get myself a girl to date, I’d realise that I was wrong all along.

I have parents that have been together for 20 something years. And I know that I’m one of the lucky few out there. They never make me work unless I’m trying to buy something without them buying it. A guy I used to talk to tells people that I’m privileged. It hurt because he doesn’t know that I have to buy my own phones I have to do my own laundry and I have to keep my grades when my parents can’t help me. I don’t consider myself privileged I consider myself lucky. His parents are divorced, but he doesn’t buy his own phone or pay his bill. He doesn’t have to buy a car, or worry about his grades.

Well now in seventh grade he told me in November (when he had a gf) that he did like me then but he didn’t have to guts to say it. Then in January after they broke up he said “ I still like you a lot and the only reason I said no was that you go to another school, I’ve wanted to date you sooo bad” So I asked my mom if I can move back to that school and I told him I was and he was like maybe we can start a relationship and I was like heck yes. Towards the end of January I went to one of his basketball games and got a picture with him and that day was amazing, throughout the months our feelings have gotten bigger and bigger, Well now that I moved to his school he was all I could talk about, THEN this girl that was considered a player told me she liked him and I was there two weeks and she already had three boyfriends and then I freaked out and I was going to ask him out Friday (it was Monday) and I did it when I got home from school and he said yes well ask me out at the end of May and I will say yes (he had just gotten out of a relationship) so I was like oml yesss well that girl told him Later that night about her feelings and then she told me that he liked her and then I texted him and asked him to explain and he fr said “we lost our spark” so I was crying and stuff and I told him why I asked him out so early, I didn’t want him to get hurt and I cannot watch him be hurt, he helped me through so much and he ment the world to me and I told him all that and right after that he kept apologizing and the he was like “I should’ve played you like that” and “we didn’t loose our spark I still have feelings for you” and he also said “when me and that girl break up you don’t have to wait you can be mine I didn’t realize o was his #2 when he said that until my friend told me and then one week later they broke up but during that relationship he completely quit talking to me. So the Monday after I was joking around and said “did we loose our spark” and he was like no I still wanna date you and then that girl was going to get another bf the day they broke up and he lead me on like we where going to date he called me perfect and said don’t let anyone say different, and he told his ex he doesn’t like her well that Sunday he asked her out and then I was like bruh what the heck and he was like I still like you.????????

I have to change my body, my mood, my personality, my beliefs, and my outfit just for all of you to say hi to me? For the love and appreciation I never got going there. Why can’t you guys just try not to piss me off all the time and make degrading remarks?? No? I have to have midnight breakdowns, go to therapy and self brainwash in order to join your cult of a clique and not be verbally beat up every day? That’s just wonderful. Hell no. I’m not about to lie to myself or to anyone else about my identity. If you can’t handle the real me then ignore it like you tell me to ignore the “hate”. Can’t do that? Then you’re just as big of a hypocrite as you want me to be. Actually bigger. Thank you.

I wanted to be friends with her, and I heard from the mutual friends that she wanted to be friends with me as well. We started talking and texting and sitting with each other at lunch, and we became fast friends. After about a month we were practically BEST FRIENDS. We did everything together. But then, her mean streak started to show. Every once in a while she would snap at me, or say something really harsh and uncalled for. One day, after her yelling at me about something I couldn’t control, I’d had enough. I decided I would try and talk to her about how I felt. But when I did, she completely retaliated and got really offended. We made up about a day later, but within the next couple of months this continued happening; Amelia would always say something really nasty to me or try to pick fights, and we would get into big blowups. We would make up really quickly though. I kept going back to her because she was a really fun person to have in other ways, and during the times she was nice we made so many good memories with each other. But enough was enough, and I had the sudden realization one day that she was a toxic friend and I deserved better; I was sick of constantly getting attacked and hurt by her. After about 10 months of our friendship, I broke it off. Yes I did get some backlash from her and she set out to try and ruin my life, but that just further made me understand what a true friend is; a true friend will treat you with kindness, respect, and makes you feel happy. I now know who my REAL friends are and will never settle for anything less again.

My mom comes inside yelling at me and I had no idea what I did. Turns out she told my mom all I talked about were guys. Which wasn’t true. My mom knew it wasn’t true when my sister said it wasn’t true. I received a text that night from her saying she didn’t have fun. So I said “it’s funny how I’m always there for you but you were never there for me.” I listed somethings off that she’s talked to me about. So now she claims that she has always been there for me.

He also got me “in trouble” at school because he told the counselor that I follow him home, and I don’t vecause one time he came off at my bus stop and then I walked with him and we talked like normal people would..that’s not called following..and then the other times I was just normally walking around my neighborhood and he comes out of nowhere and starts yelling “This is not okay you need to leave” and I wasn’t even doing anything..but..I saw him hiding behind a tree or whatever before he ran out and yelled..so technically he was “stalking” me. So after all that stopped, I made accounts to text him that I’m sorry. And then finally he added me back and answerd saying “What” (I think I don’t remember) but anyways I then asked him why he hates me and he sent me this : “Stop don’t want to talk to you why are you pushing this stop all you’re doing is pushing and pushing and pushing until you get your way that’s wha toddlers do you need to grow up move on and leave me the fuck alone. Because you push and act like a fucking baby I sincerely hope nobody has to deal with this shit like I do it’s tiring as fuck I am actually tierd that’s why I hate you. Dose nothing go through your head you’re pushing still I hate you and everybody hates you and it’s all for the same reason you push and don’t stop makes me hate having snapchat I spend more time blocking you then checking stories. Because you push and don’t say you won’t becaise you break promises if you add me one more time you’ll regret it trust me you will I can’t deal with this anymore I’ve spent hours just blocking you trust me” So..yeah.. I still accidentally made an account to text him because to be honest I cannot control myslef.. Then he kept getting me “in trouble” at school or whatever.

I will explain what happened from the beginning. So my best friend Emily started hating my sister as she hit her on the head with a teddy so then I said well hang on Emily your the one who made her said in a stinging nettle bush your the one who mad scars down her arm and your the one that hit her on the head with loads and loads of force. She said that she didn’t care and that everyone should hate me as I am going out with two boys I’m not cheating as the boys love each other the same way as I love them and then she said I bet your period has stopped as I saw someone knocking you up whilst you were asleep but she doesn’t know the real story of that. So finally the bus came and they shut up. You are probably wanting to know what Emily doesn’t know that night I was raped and I do have the details as I went to the clinic.

I’ve wanted to go back to one school as it has people that I consider my real friends at it. For three years out of my high school life, I’ve hung around people I barely even know, and call them my friends. One friend, I’ll call him Harry, has been the only one I’ve talked to at this new school I’m currently going to for my junior year. He’s made fat jokes, gay jokes, and everything in between, but that’s just how we joked around. At least I thought that was what it was.After the end of the first semester he started to change for the worst. I realized he was trying to fight me and get his friends to stop liking me or even talking to me. I still messed with him every morning of our guitar class, but one day I did the thing where you tip someone’s hat off and he straight up punched me in the face and called me worthless. The only friend I had turned on me. I started getting way more depressed and sad after school. I stopped talking to my long distance girlfriend as much, I stopped talking to anyone, including my parents, and Harry just kept fucking pushing, punching, and talking shit about me. I just felt alone. There seemed to be no one to turn to and no one to talk to. I just wanted to pain to end.

Like when ur crush smiles at you, you already assume he likes you. Or when he tries to help you with something like arranging a chair in a classroom, you always blush and cringe to death and assume he likes youuu. That is the case from where I came from. Sex is not a thing, really in my place. It just ends with a kiss, that’s all but it’s rare too because like what I said, it’s a conservative country. Anyhow, this just happened last year. Actually it’s not a relationship. It did not end up in a “love love” relationship. We wounded up being friends only. Here’s why. It was the first day of school. I rarely see him at school when I was in 7th to 9th grade because this time, I am classmate with him. The school here is different. We don’t move from room to room. Instead, we stay in a classroom and we are called a section. The teachers are the ones who move from classes to classes instead of students. So yeah. And, days passed, we were getting closer to each other. It started with facebook messenger when he was always asking me about school stuff, what are the homework, projects, tests and presentations because guysss, from where I came from, subjects are really hard and it homework are very difficult. We also had like 6 quizzes in a day. Can u believe that? Lmao. So it started with those stuff. Until eventually our conversation always ends up with asking our hobbies and interests and what do u wanna be when you grow up and whatnots. Because in person, even though we are classmates, we really dont talk that much. Butttt months passed, heee’s the one who always initiates a conversation in real life. He became impressed with my english grammars and how I think deeply of things. Now let’s go to flirting. I am not that girl who flirts so he’s the one who does that. My way of flirting is to impress guys by my intellectual functions like reading, exceeding in all school works and helping my classmates who are in trouble with their understanding of a lesson by discussing it loudly so boys could turn around and hear me explain some things the other boys may not understand it too so the probability is, some of them may approach me and ask me to explain it to them as well. Somthing like that lool. So yeah, he started flirting with me by always chatting me frequently and talks of his dreams. He wanted to be a lawyer, a soldier and an accountant at the same time and wooow dude, i think he was trying to impress me. Next thing is, he already knew i have a crush with him. I told my friend to chat him saying “She has a crush on you” and told her not to tell him It came from me. So she said that. His reaction was horrible on the chat. He was like: OMG and he keeps on changing the subject. So what happened is I had a fight with my friend about that claiming I used her to gain myself a benefit smth like that. But days passed. My friend and I didnt talk but when we got back to each other, she told me that he told her something about the confession I gave. He said “it is not that I am numb. I was just suprised. That’s all.” After that. He flirted more, he always comes near me during classes, and the most wonderful thing is he said I look so cute when I smile. No guy has ever said that to me. He’s also my first dance in Pre-prom-kind-of party (lmao). He said he is going to miss me once I go to USA. Butttt guyyss, here is a plot twist, I already knew he had fallen on someone way back 9th grade. I knew it before the first flirt happened. I was sad already but it didnt make sense because why would he be so nice to me. It also feels like he has fallen into me. This sounds corny right now but letters are not alive enough to express my emotions. Like its not just the flirts. He cared for me. But i was still confused because I already have fallen for him. But in the end he chose that someone. Even though that someone doesnt even notice his efforts. It was my first love but actually it is a failure. Now i am already here in USA. As friends, he told me he wouldnt still forget me but you know, 5 months passed, we’re already out of keeping in touch. He is already bringing that someone to malls and dining together in a restaurant. I dunno, this is boring but I was really hurt. I learned that you do not have to force it if doesnt want to turn out the way you want them to be. Some things are out of your control and you just have to accept it                                                                                       ",869,17.25,77.62,63.88,73.09,12.97,13.69,94.82,64.10,23.71,15.42,6.79,1.50,1.73,4.95,0.46,8.29,4.95,12.77,9.09,8.86,7.71,2.07,19.22,2.53,2.19,2.42,1.04,1.38,4.95,3.68,1.15,0.23,0.12,0.46,17.84,0.00,1.50,0.81,4.95,12.54,2.42,1.84,0.92,2.42,1.15,4.37,1.96,0.23,1.15,0.46,1.15,0.00,0.35,0.12,0.35,8.06,4.83,1.27,1.50,0.58,0.35,7.59,11.39,0.58,15.42,2.99,5.87,6.90,3.34,1.38,0.46,0.12,0.12,0.23,1.50,0.23,0.81,0.35,0.12,0.12,14.15,7.48,3.80,0.12,0.00,0.12,0.00,0.35,0.69,1.38,0.23,0.00

No period. No babies. Oh. Yeah. No sex either (kind of?). I have ovaries. So I can still have children that are genetically mine (through IVF and surrogacy) and I can adopt too. But. When I first found out - I didn’t feel human. In fact I felt useless. I wanted to disappear. Somehow just not exist anymore. I felt like I wasn’t a real woman. Real women have periods, real woman can have children, and real women have bodies like the health books. I couldn’t even have sex without undergoing a surgery or something called dilation (look it up). My life changed on the day I was diagnosed. 1 in 5,000 female births result in my condition.

He turned out to be using me the whole time to get to her. She didn’t do anything about it. Then she told me him and her were having sex and I leaked out to everyone on accident but we all come to find out she was pregnant. So I felt bad. I tried to be there for her but I was blocked on everything. Keep in mind she lives across the street. I spent every day writing her letters and trying to talk to her. I wanted to fix things. I told myself I deserved it. But almost 4 years of not talking later she is trying to be friends with me again. I’m still In love with her but she is getting married in a couple months I don’t want to fall back into that situation to just get my heart broken.

He was tall, muscular big and dark skin. Come to find out he was Portuguese and going to school to become a lawyer. Well when school started back he told my mom that he loved me and wanted to be with me and no one else. I had a bf and I couldn’t break up with him to be with this other guy bc then my heart would’ve been broken back to back. He turned 20 this past January. He won’t date me bc I’m only 17. He told me that when I’m 18 he would date me. Whenever we hangout we flirt hard with each other and my friends mistake us for bf/gf.

Before this happened I had always questioned my sexuality, some nights it would keep me up for hours trying to determine the difference between how I really felt and how I was raised I should be. I never could finger it out and still I’m questioning some things. Just a few months ago I was hanging out with one of my friends, I knew she is lesbian and attractive but never thought I was sexually attracted to her. She is older so we drove to her friends appartment to hang out. We ended up, all three, wrestling each other. The other friend went to go to the bathroom but we kept wrestling, when she got over me I felt my heart race faster and all sweaty, she was looking good. In the next moment she leaned in and kissed me... and I kissed back! I was so surprised with myself and scared that when I realized what I was doing I pushed her away. We looked at each other stunned, I could tell she felt really bad but surprised I kissed back. Her friend came back and didn’t know anything happened but as I sat there I could feel my vagina had a heart beat and my ears were tingly. Later on the ride home we talked about it and although my denial I knew in my mind that was all me and I was gay. Not one other incounter with men had made me feel the same and other thoughts had begun to come together... it all made sense. It was just that in the moment action and a feeling that had been deep down for a long time that came through.

I was in love with this boy from my school named Kale. He was tall blond and beautiful. I wasn’t sure if he was gay or not but everyone said he was so I went for it. I started a streak with Kale. He was all for it. I was so excited like Kale J was wanting to start being friends with me. After a month or two we became closer. It was nice. So I was afraid to tell him I had feelings so what better way than to make a vague post on my spam account. So after having it on there for two weeks he texted me. “Who’s your post about?” Being a complete wuss I said “no one and particular.” And I asked why he was curious. No answer. After asking him for three days he finally said “idk because I thought it was about me and it was kinda weird...” My heart shattered into a million pieces. “No Kale, I can assure you it wasn’t about you just who I see myself with.” How could he do this to me. How could my friends say go for it when he wouldn’t be interested in me. From there I had a period of time where I was diagnosed with depression and was almost put in medication. But I wouldn’t let them put me on meds. Instead I went and talked to close friends and teachers about this. I cried a lot. But I’m better now. Weeks went by not looking or talking to each other in the hallway. I hated myself. I hated him. Finally he talked to me. Just saying hi and I just stared at him shocked. What did he want from me. Just to say hi. 4-14-2018 was the day that Kale told everyone he was gay and had a boyfriend. That was the day that I realized that I wouldn’t let a boy play with my emotions like that. I never got an apology. A “hey I was a jerk sorry about that. 4-14-2018 was the day that I learned who my real friends are.

My ways of flirting have actually become a part of my daily routine. But people know that if I don’t go up and start talking to a guy I like then they know my feelings for him are real. This past weekend I went to a wedding. I wore heels and a short dress. That night at the reception I saw this guy that sat near me during the ceremony and I couldn’t help but smile every time I looked at him. Finally they started playing good music the kind u could actually dance too. I got up and started dancing. After the song ended I walked off stage to go get a drink. I noticed that guy was up there dancing doing his little thing. I finally got the guts to even dance beside him. A slow song came on and we were both standing there so awkwardly. I turned and asked if he wanted to dance. He put the biggest smile on his face and said yes. I couldn’t help but smile the whole time bc this guy was actually taller than me. I mean 6’3” tall. We danced some more then he asked me to slow dance again and by the third slow song it became a mutual agreement to slow dance with each other. After a few more songs I pulled him off the dance floor to take pictures. His family started yelling with excitement for him. We laughed and took pictures. Afterwards I grabbed his hand to pull him towards my family before I knew it he intertwined his fingers with mine. His hugs were great. Later he asked me for my number and I said yes. Come to find out he’s across the U.S. I didn’t know that night became the best night of my life. Even tho we only talked for a day he’s still really important to me and I wish he knew just how much he made me happy that night.

I don’t want things to be awkward or anything and I’m really scared. I’m still debating on it. It’s so soon that I’m gonna have to make up my mind eventually. Well that’s all for now.

I am a guy and when puberty hit and I started developing as a female I knew something was very wrong.Estrogen is the female hormone and it is what causes chest development and curves, thinner body hair, a higher voice, a round face, mood swings, and for most people a very low sex drive. Testosterone is the male hormone and it’s what causes thick facial and body hair, a promenant jawline, a deep voice, easily agitated, and a high sex drive. Puberty and estrogen hit me like a truck. I had developed a large chest and a fragile frame. My periods kept me bed ridden from the pain they caused and it was never shorter than 10 days for me. It made me seclude myself and hide from social situations. You could say I was depressed but I see it as distressed. I came out as transgender after pushing myself to be feminine and to “work through it.” A bit after that I started testosterone. It honestly saved me from potentially hurting myself. I am now more confident and outgoing. Also I recently hit my 1 year mark. I have a bit of straggly facial hair, some acne, and my weight shifted from my hips to mainly my stomach. I am taking the bad with the good. I am honestly so glad that something like this exists.Keep positive everyone. Your time WILL come and you WILL thrive.

295,29523,,squarespace,,,,no,,Female,,17,,NA,,,,puberty,"                  II’m 17 years old and I lot my virginity when I was 14 (i knwo it’s a young age, I’ve been judge about it since it happened). Well me current boyfriend James (he’s 18)and I have been together for 3 months. He’s currently enlisted into the United States Marines and he was just deployed overseas for 7 months, he left 2 weeks ago (on March 2nd). I realized that my period never came last month and I’m once again late this month, so I called my best friend Karen and told her what was going on. She comes over about 20 minutes later with 2 bags from CVS. She bought a ton of pregnancy tests and lots of ice cream. I took the bags from her and went into the bathroom. My other friend Kayla (she’s a teen mom) told me that it’s best to me into a cup then dip the test instead of peeing directly on the stick, that way if there’s an issue you don’t have to wait until the next time that you have to pee. I pissed in the cup and opened one of the 4 boxes of test (each box had 3 tests in them). I dipped the stick in and I set my timer. Once the timer went up I checked the tests, I pulled the first one out and it was negative, so I checked the next one and it said negative. I checked the third one and was getting ready to get rid of the cup that I just pissed in, when I saw the test said positive. I dropped the test on the ground, thankfully Karen was there so I didn’t get hurt. She told me to go ahead and try another box of tests, but I wanted to knwo final results so I opened all of the boxes. I then put my timer on and then waited. Once my timer went off I grabbed the first stick, it said negative. The second one said negative. The third one said positive. The fourth one said positive. The fifth one said positive. The sixth one said positive. The seventh one said positive. The eighth one said positive. The nineth one said positive. I looked at Karen as I thought “how the hell am I supposed to tell James that I’m pregnant” and then the thought cane to my mind “what if he doesn’t want to be a dad” and then my final thought was “how the hell am I gonna be able to take care of a baby all by myself while he’s gone”.Now, we’re gonna skip 4 days. I saw my primary care doctor and she confirmed that I am 7 weeks pregnant. I had my weekly video call with James today but I knew that I would’ve be able to actually tell him that I’m pregnant so I got creative and made a shirt. It was black and had the US Marines EGA symbol on it in the center. On the top it said “My boyfriend is a US Marine.” and on the bottom near my stomachach, it said “My daddy is a US Marine.” and it had two little baby feet under it. I sat at the computer waiting for him to call, he finally called around 6pm. He answered the phone with his usual “hey there gorgeous” I smiled and said “hey sexy” (it’s just something we’ve said since we met). We talked for a while and when he saw my shirt he only saw the top and he said “awe that’s so sweet babe” I told him that there was more to the shirt and he looked confused so I stood up.

Every guy I met either wanted just to hook up or were simply uncomfortable with showing affection. Now that I’ve seen a few people I’m not sure whether or not sex is something I want to consider, especially in a small town like mine where everyone knows everything and slut-shaming is the rage even among parents. Although I’m pretty much educated on subjects such as birth control, contraception, STDs and such, the actual decision making process is terrifying. But I also feel as though I don’t have an outlet; I never even discussed what a period was with my mom or the basics of puberty and it seems late to start being open with them on a more mature level. Most of my friends are guys or are just as or more inexperienced as me. I know sex should be my own personal preference but I’m not sure whether to go on the pill or just not have it at all.

In this day in age, relationships are reffered to as, “That’s my baby ?” Anyways, she sent me a picture of him and undeniably he was really cute but he was in the 11th grade while my friend was in the 9th. I mean, not that much generational age gap but he was so tall and so big and my friend was so short. How did she possibly kiss him? However, she proceeded to tell me about how his dick ? was eight inches. ? some things are just best kept secret. She said they tried having sex but it didn’t quite fit. I didn’t believe her because we use to walk to school together when she use to live in my hometown before she moved and she was always the good girl ? I would never think she would lose her virginity at 14. I’m 15 and still a proud virgin! Then, she went on to say that he popped her cherry ? and it hurt a lot and began to bleed so he stopped, but she decided to give him a BJ. Also, she mentioned she was eaten out once and sucked a couple ?? oh my goodness ? at this point I was star struck and bewildered beyond confused. She said she was a freak and liked being tied up and a whole bunch of weird things, but let’s just say I learned a lot about the way the human body worked that day ???

We were lowkey a thing, because we'd always hold hands, cuddle, and go everywhere together. He told my sister that he liked me, and that I was one of the only people he'd cry for if I died. I told him how I liked him in december, over Christmas break.

I'm not sure if the reaction was healthy or not, but I know it confused me. Even now I still like that boy. We're best friends, and things are still confusing.

At my last school, there were lots of boys and I had a crush on a lot of them, but I started to get a crush on my best friend. I kept telling myself that I was straight and just wanted to be bisexual or gay, but I now realize that I do like girls. The problem is, my new school is mostly girls, so I know for sure that I like girls. But there are barely any guys at my school to know if I like boys at all, and it confuses me. I don’t now what my sexual orientation is, and questioning sounds good but it confuses me making it sound like I for sure like guys and/or girls. I’m just very confused all together, and I feel pressured to just be gay. I don’t know what i am, and I feel like I can only be out to people if I have a label.

392,39233,,squarespace,,,,,,Female,no,16,,NA,,,,relationships,"                                 During my freshman year of highschool I was in geometry. It's the very last class of the day so usually I just want to get it over with. But when after a couple months of changing seat learning people's names, and stuff I'm seated next to this guy, name T for short. I thought he was cute but I knew that I really didn't want to be in a relationship yet because I really just wanted to focus on myself. But he started noticing me too. He asked for my number and I was like sure why not like we could just be friends but no. His friends would tell me he liked me and that he thought I was beautiful and nice. I thought it was very sweet of him but like I said I didn't want to be in a committed relationship yet. As months go by in class T starts to make his move , he surprises me with flowers, food, and all these little gifts and it makes me feel bad. I tell him how I feel but apparently he doesn't get the message because the following day he buys these red roses and ask me in front of everyone. I felt so pressured. I felt anxiety just taking over my body because everyone was just telling me to say yes. I said yes. But I tried talking to him about how I wanted to focus on myself and stuff but I think the one reason why I stayed with him is because he said "" I want to be the one your with when you achieve that goal."" It kinda made me feel important to someone. It was nice and reassuring that I could mean something to someone. It was nice the first couple of months but as month 4 came along it hit me hard, he got controlling , telling me what to wear, telling me to loose weight, telling me to only talk to him. I was heartbroken. I was only in this for him. He pressured me to at least try to have sex with him but I didn't. I couldn't give it up for him. It was important to me and I just knew I would regret if I did. Eventually I broke up with him after 9 months. It took a long time to realize my self worth because I let T's words and opinion control me. Now that I'm entering senior year I've learned a lot from that experience. I have a boyfriend of and year and a half and I can say I'm truly happy with him. He knows the story and he always put effort into helping me love myself again and trusting him with my heart. Pressure is hard. Tbh and it's funny because the people who told me to be with T, eventually told me after when we broke up that I was better off without him, that I was too good for him like first off. You have no say in anything because you wanted me to, you kept pressuring me too. People just didn't understand how much it affected me. Overall I just wanted to tell incoming freshmen,sophomores, juniors , and even seniors you are in control of everything. If you feel pressured in a relationship you have the right to either say , make a change, or get out. I know it's easier said than done , and it might be sad and scary at first but trust me. You will feel all that stress come off your shoulders. Figure out to love yourself first please. You got your whole life ahead of you to find love just enjoy it like got to parties or just chill with friends. Life your life to your fucking fullest.

I have a really tight friend group- I love all my friends so much. There is this one girl in the group- let’s call he Jackie. She’s the one person I trust most of all, and I love her so much, I would do anything for her. About 8 months ago I came to the realization that I felt much more for Jackie than just a love in friendship. Ever since then I’ve been dealing with having a crush on her, maybe even being in love with her if that’s a possible thing to be. Of course I can never tell her, she’s beautiful and amazing and wonderful and we are so compatible but imagine if I did tell her. Scenario A. Is she doesn’t feel the same way and then things are weird- our friendship-maybe our friend group unravels and falls apart. Scenario B. She does feel the same way- but high school relationships are not forever and one day we will end up splitting and that is going to do the same thing as scenario A. The obvious answer is to shut up and find somebody else to like, but it’s not that simple. When I spend every week with her, I realize more and more who great we work together, and I realize more and more how much I need to say how I feel. So what do I do, I’ve been thinking about this for 8 months and I still don’t know.

January came around my birthday was coming and we had the worst argument ever and we had stopped talking and it was the worst month ever I was soo down I can’t even explain.my dad didn’t come to my birthday you decided to do something behind my back and your friends had send me a video of you doing stuff with another girl my brother ended up in the hospital my sister was to drunk to even remember about me soo my family was just family apart more and more every time.a few weeks past...my phone went off and it was you and I just remember that you say “I’m sorry for everything “ and I told you “it’s fine it’s always been fine because my feelings for you always get in the way no matter how hurt I get” and at that point I I felt stupid I said that but some how you told me “I knew you liked me “ and I was just going crazy in my head because I didn’t kn what to do and we just talking about everything and things were exactly the same but we both got back to talking we where getting back to talk but all of a sudden I were just dry texting me and just blaming me for everything no matter what it was and I was soo into u I would let you hurt because I was stupid and I didn’t see it we still had r good moments but it was just not the same and I was hurt inside because I never felt this way before you were just different but we both had bad past things were never ok. I don’t remember when it was but you had gotten into the worst argument with your mom and you had left home and u went to stay at this apartment that your grandma let u stay don’t remember exactly what happen but I was always there for u I would stay up listening to u and waiting for you because u were busy making money trying to make it and I just wanted to be there for u show u that I care that I’m not leaving no matter what happen I’m here Bc I loved you...it was something in the morning when I was just in my feelings and I called you crying and you were just trying to make me laughing and you told me to ask you “how much do u love me” so I asked and u said I can’t tell you you have to wait and I was just being a baby because u weren’t telling be but we were still laughing and I fell asleep otp with u and you decide to text me. “I love you goodnight ????” but that wasn’t the only thing the questing you told me to tell you u had answered it and what you said made my day I was crying because I was happy and I remember every word and it said “I asked you to ask me how much do I love you and well I love you so much that I adore everything about u from ur temper tantrums to ur tired yawns you da first n last person I think about everyday I love ur laugh n when u happy I’m happy when u sad I’m sad n I love ur lil baby teeth and cute eyes n perfect lips ???u could damn near say that I’m in love with you n that’s crazy for me to say n it’s hard to admit that n I haven’t felt like this in a long time? so I love you goodnight my little big baby?????” when o had read that I knew I just fell for you even more thing just felt right until again I started getting distance and thing just went out of place but I kinda understand you were busy most the time trying to get your stuff together and working to keep yourself up but I was still there when u need me. Months past we were on and off we talking we don’t really talk otp as much we just texted but my feelings for u never changed. And now we still talk but it’s not the same any little thing I do is wrong and u make me feel bad about it we r on and off with everything I still have deep feeling for u so it’s hard For me to leave you even tho u have changed a lot I still read all the things you have wrote for me and sometimes I do sit at night thinking did u even mean them because u and done much behind my back that I think I don’t kn about but I always find out...I still love you but things r different this isn’t a movie where it ends with a happy ending it’s reality and not ends with a happy ever after but my heart always has a part that belongs to u and I’m still here for you no matter how much u hurt me I can’t give up on u live everyone else did.i wish I could continue but things r just complicated..

It all started in 4th grade when I first met her. We were amazing friends and we told each other everything... until she started making things up about me for attention. (4th grade)I missed a day of school, and she started telling people (that day while I was gone) that I had lice and not to hang out with me or they'll get it too. I DID NOT HAVE LICE. All throughout 4th grade ever since then I became extremely lonely and very sad. (5th grade) I got my first boyfriend, and she was jealous bc she liked him, so she started telling people that I got an STD from him. I haven't even had my first kiss yet, tf? (6th grade) She pushed me down a hill while I was on roller blades and I broke my arm. Then she ran away and I had to carry my skates home. (four blocks away from where I was) Then bc I got a bunch of ( attention) for it, she started wearing fake arm braces and faking injuries for actual attention. After that people began to call her an 'attention whore', a 'slut' and even more. Talk about Karma. (7th grade) We've been in school for six months and she's already dated 7 guys. Cheated on half of them, had sex under my neighbors trampoline (NOT HER PROPERTY OR THE BOYS PROPERTY), Kissed every guy she's been with on the first day of dating them, had sex with almost all of them even though not one relationship has lasted longer than two weeks. And she's now asking me why my Mom don't like her? Bitch the fuck?!

I was in the same class with the same people from 2nd grade - 5th grade. In fifth grade in about March 3 boys in my class started to do these dares. The dares would be to ""smack my butt"" or to ""grab my boobs"". Reminder: we're in FIFTH grade. At first I though that this is just what boys do but then I realized that it isn't. Other boys in my class didn't act that way.  So after 1 month of these dares getting harsher and harsher I finally told my teacher. She stopped it but after she stopped it j still felt like I was being used. Like I was just a doll. Like I was just a part of their twisted little game.

At the time this guy had a girlfriend but he was flirting with me. He made me feel special. He told me I was a princess and I should be treated like one! So of course at this point any teen girl is going to like a cute guy calling you a princess. I fell so hard for him and when he finally broke up with his girlfriend I just knew it was my turn. I had been waiting so long and it was actually my time to shine. Me and him became best friends and he started to like me. But for some reason deep down I knew I wasn’t quite good enough for him. I kept trying anyways. I prayed every night and every time I got the chance all my friends said he’s playing you! I refused to move on. I thought if I let him go I would be nothing and no other guy would like me. He made me feel wanted.. wanted for my body we only wanted me for sex he always tried to get me to do stuff with him but I came to realize this is my body I will do what I want with it, and what I want is not what he wants.. I finally dropped the idea of him and I and I prayed for the right guy and finally the right guy found me and now I’m treated like a princess!! Never settle for less! You are worth more! Don’t waste your time like I did! If I could redo anything this is what it would be bc I fell in the trap and I don’t want anyone else to fall for what I did!

I have social anxiety, and not knowing anyone there was intimidating. I met a girl and we started talking and realized we had a lot in common. She invited me to eat lunch with her and even gave me her pack of Oreos. Over time I realized I had feelings for her. I asked her out and she said yes. In that moment everything felt so perfect. She seemed to care about me, and I loved her more than anything. We only dated for a short time until she told me her mom wasn’t going to allow her to date until high school. We agreed to stay close and date when our freshman year came. I ended up going to the hospital and needing to leave school. We were still talking, but when I asked her if we could get together, she always said she was busy. We stopped talking as frequently, but I never stopped caring. Just yesterday, I saw she had posted a picture on instagram of her girlfriend - her NEW girlfriend who she had decided not to tell me about, and all this time I thought she still cared. As if that wasn’t bad enough, her mom had commented saying they were “cute”. She lied to me about her mom saying she couldn’t date just so she wouldn’t have to break up with me. I ended up blocking her, but i forgot to block her iMessage, so she texted me and asked why I blocked her. I lied and told her I had blocked a bunch of people just because i had too many followers. She responded saying she was actually thinking about asking me to go do something with her this week. I know that is a lie because every time i ask her if she is mad at me she answers with the same thing. I unblocked her so I could still see her Instagram if i wanted to. She said she wasn’t mad (i still was but i was pretending not to be). We said goodnight and went to sleep. I woke up today to find she had blocked me on Instagram and iMessage. I trusted her and cared about her for so long, but I guess she never felt the same about me.

I mean I would. But anyways we ended up breaking up. Then after a while I went up to his friend and I asked him if he still liked me. To my surprise he said yes. Then I told him that I really liked him. He responded with the omg this cant be happening look and a huge smile on his face and then he opened his arms to hug me and at that moment when his arms were wrapped around me I felt safe and secure. Then we were pretty much dating after that. It was the best relationship I had ever been in. Word got out in school and then people told him I said things I didn’t and they told me he said things that he didn’t. I said a few things after that which I completely regret. He later said if anyone asks we aren’t dating which kinda hurt. Then like three days after he spent me a text breaking up with me.

To be honest at first it was just a crush because he was cute, but then my friend texted him for me and things kinda took off. He told me he liked me, but didn’t want a realtionship because his life was too complicated. After about two months we ended up getting together, but he wasn’t very touchy and hasn’t really been in relationships. He was always very busy and now that I go back and read messages it was like I was having a conversation by myself. Anyway he broke up with me about three months ago and said he loves me, but he doesn’t make me happy. Me being the person I am constantly chased him for the last three months seeking answers. He constantly tells me I’m amazing and he regrets leaving me, but he won’t be with me because I deserve so much better. I guess a part of me always thought he was lying because he said I deserve better yet I didn't think I deserved anything at all. I guess it seemed like it was just an excuse to leave. Lately I’ve realized it doesn’t matter what he says because the truth is he’s never proved to me what he says is true and I need to walk away because the truth is I wasn’t happy. I just don’t understand why I chased after him for so long when I knew I wasn’t. I finally am I a better place in this whole situation, but still when I hear his name or see him it’s like my whole mood changes.

When I realized I was attracted to him, I found myself always wanting a hug from him and kept glancing at him. We both had third period together which was art. In the class we were given assigned seats so he was in front I was in the middle row. I was working on my art project when I felt someone looking at me so I looked up and saw him looking at me, ended up just looking at each other. I could tell I was attracted to him because it had a different feeling from my last crush. When some people say they get those butterflies in their tummies, that’s how I felt. I was always happy around him. He always knew how to bring my mood up as we got to know each other more. I was happy to the point my face was hurting from smiling so much and I felt so giggly. Which was really weird because I never had these feelings before. But that’s all been cut short. He’s got a girlfriend now so we barely talk.

He was really popular and lots of girls liked him, so I was really surprised when he asked me out. I said yes and we started dating. I was really happy because of this, but my friends didn’t trust him because he was so popular and they warned me, but I ignored them. Around a month later I overheard him and his friends talking about how he really liked my BFF and was dating me to get closer to her. I was so sad but didn’t know if I should tell him that I heard him. I decided to and broke up with him because I couldn’t be in a relationship with him after I found out he was using me. I debated if whether I should tell my BFF or not but I did, and she helped me get through it and I was glad that I told her.

To feel your pulse race when they walk in a room. The overwhelming thought of “what do they think of me?” To go somewhere, anywhere and see an attractive guy/girl. To follow them with your eyes, begging them to notice you and talk to you. That feeling is what we all look for, for whatever reason we all have.

Anyways I wasn’t aloud to date him but I dated him behind my mom back and well we dated for a year throughout the year I thought maybe I needed to change so I would starve myself so I could look pretty and well what I would do was drink lots of water and chew gum to make my hunger go away .. since I was doing that I was hurting myself and I felt sad and well that got to me and I started to cut I made it unnoticeable so I wouldn’t get caught everyone was concern by my image cause I was losing lots of weight and they were asking if I was okay and I would always say yes. Well in my mind all I could focus on was to be skinny so my boyfriend could love me even more he would be so nice to me and well I loved the way he would call me his princess and everything but I felt like I didnt like my image I was constantly looking at the mirror and crying cause I felt ugly and not like the models but that’s what matter I was bullied for a year in 5th grade and that effected me a lot which I think made me do all those things I thought about suicide and well I tired killing myself but I was to scared and I only wanted to do it because I was ugly looking by and I knew the world didn’t want to see me but I had a greag friend by my side and supports me up to this day just know that you guys are strong and you guys are worth a lot this is my first story but I don’t know if I did this right I just want to let you guess know don’t let anyone tell you what and who you are because that’s what makes you unique                                                                     ",460,5.21,23.00,81.16,70.75,115.00,8.70,95.22,66.96,26.30,20.22,15.00,1.09,1.30,2.61,0.22,6.09,3.48,10.65,11.96,6.52,10.43,2.17,22.17,3.04,1.30,1.96,0.65,1.74,7.17,4.78,2.39,0.22,0.87,0.87,10.87,0.65,1.52,0.43,3.48,16.52,3.26,3.26,3.70,3.04,1.09,3.48,2.83,1.30,0.22,1.30,1.96,0.00,0.22,0.00,1.30,3.91,2.39,0.43,0.43,0.43,0.43,10.00,6.96,0.43,10.87,1.09,4.13,6.09,0.87,0.43,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.43,3.26,0.00,0.00,0.65,2.17,0.43,3.48,0.87,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.61,0.00,0.00

Right after first i see my boyfriend or soon to be ex. i run up to him and i said what aidan (the guy who told me he wanted to break up with me) said is it true. he quickly comes in and tries to hug me and says sorry and i left in tears. the whole day crying. can you imagine that it was like getting slapped without a warning. then the next couple days rumors start arising that i cheated on him and bunch of crap. i was so mad then a couple days later he had already asked out two girls and they both said no. weeks later one of the girls (we will call her regan for now) so regan showed me messages were my ex boyfriend (we will call him liam) liam says that he just really wanted to be with her was why he left me all this confusion rushed to my head i was trying to ignore everything. to make my life just a bit worse at this time my dad was in rehab in another country my mom had left me with my grandparents so i didn’t even have her through everything. and then the next week my aunt who had had leukemia cancer for a year died (we were very close) i didn’t even get to go to her funeral due to the fact it was far away and it meant missing theee weeks of school causing me to fail the year. and my uncle and grandpa had gotten in a really bad car crash in which my uncle (17 yo) has both legs broken (we were really close too) and i had no friends at the time to turn to. wanna know something hilarious though my 4 year bestfriend now was one of the girls liam asked out                                                                       ",416,36.75,68.46,93.41,2.47,24.47,10.82,96.63,58.65,21.15,15.62,9.13,1.68,0.24,4.33,0.24,5.53,4.09,14.18,7.69,5.77,6.73,2.16,17.79,3.12,1.68,1.44,2.16,2.16,4.09,0.72,3.37,0.00,0.96,1.20,17.07,1.68,1.92,2.40,5.77,9.13,1.92,0.96,0.96,0.96,1.92,2.64,1.92,0.48,1.20,0.24,1.68,0.72,0.96,0.00,0.00,8.89,3.85,1.68,2.16,0.72,0.96,10.34,6.49,1.68,21.63,2.16,7.69,11.30,1.44,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.48,1.44,0.24,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.00,7.45,3.61,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.48,2.88,0.00

That summer our moms became best friends and so me and him got close, the next year we started dating but a month later I broke up with him. We were still friends and I immediately regretted my decision. Then In the sixth grade he started dating a 7th grader but later that year his mom, him, and his sisters moved in. Soon after they moved back out but our moms became best friends again. September of 2017 he was still with his girlfriend but me and him started having long conversations late at night admitting our feelings for one another and in October his mother moved back in and has lived here ever since. Thanksgiving we told each we loved one another. In January he told me that he would have already broken up with his girlfriend if I wasn’t moving. (I’m traveling for six months.) my friend sent him a message the other day telling him to choose and he showed the message to his girlfriend. I took that as him choosing her. His parents have joint custody so when he his at my house I’m going to start leaving. We have liked each other for four years and he chose her without knowing it and he broke my heart all over again.

He was a player as people would say. He’d go from girl to girl. I knew this, he added me on Snapchat and tried but I declined. I think he saw this as a challenge and decided to try even harder. One day he asked me to take him home after school and he was very persistent and I really can’t say no to people. When we got closer to his house he invited me in to meet his cat. Well while we were inside he kissed me and this kiss was nothing like I’ve ever experienced before. He was a good kisser and I really liked it. After a few days he decided to ask me out. Many people warned me about it and I decided to ignore them. I saw the good in him. Weeks later he messaged me and asked me just to be friends. I begged and begged for him not to make that decision. After that he still continued to lead me on. He told me he missed me and wanted to hangout. Then he blocked me from everything and said I was a sweet girl and that we were just different. It honestly broke my heart. I really liked this guy. I remember seeing he blocked me and my heart dropped, and I went to my car and cried. This pain was nothing like i ever experienced before. I felt my heart drop and I cried constantly. I didn’t listen to music for awhile cuz everything reminded me of him. Passing his road everytime I had to go to work killed me and I took the longer way home just to avoid it. I’m still not over it. But my friends have helped me through this and I just want people to know it gets better with time.

I say “guy, get to the point.” He told me “I have a crush on a girl. And it might be you.” As he starts rambling again I think about my boyfriend. We were going on 3 years. Is it right to leave him for a new experience like this? I cut my friend off again. “I like you too.” “Oh thank god.” He smiles and laughs. Pretty soon after he kisses me. Before I knew it I was in a love triangle. Because both options seemed appealing and I didn’t have the heart to hurt either of them. I took a couple of days to get my thoughts and my heart together, but I just felt empty. Nothing sounded right to me. Monday night my boyfriend texts me, telling me I should go be with my friend.  “I’ll still be here if it turns out badly. I’ll still love you. But I want you to have this experience. If you don’t it’ll eat up the both of us. This is what’s best.”My heart shattered. I was up all night crying. But when the sun came up, I was fine. The tears were gone.

He was 18 and I'm 16 I'm not technically allowed to date yet but he connected with me on this level that no one else could. He was absolutely amazing, just fantastic and he understood me and was always there for me like no one else does. Anyways, my older brother found out we were dating after I kept sneaking away to see my ex (Michael) and he did tell my parents. And I know, other teens may have not of done this before or may have. But my parents were accusing him of so much that he didn't do, I don't care to explain and so they took all of my electronics away and I've also had to sneak and buy a phone myself b/c it helps with my depression honestly. But he and i haven't talked since 1-3-18 and it's been the worst year of my life so far. And so I'm dealing with depression and he doesn't want to talk to me.

He has known that I’ve had feelings for him for a while, yet he always seems flirty? Anytime I ask him about it he just laughs it off. Well since we’re in high school, we party a lot together and yes usually we drink a little but not enough to be full out drunk. Here recently he’s been more depressed and he’s been getting full out drunk when we go to parties. Well I asked him about it a few days ago and and he told me he’s been trying to purposely get alcohol poisoning because he wants to die. I tried to get him to talk to me about it but he just kept telling me that he wants to die and that he loves me and things like that. Well since we’re so close, I’ve learned how to tell if he’s joking or not (even when texting) and he wasn’t joking. He kept making these suicidal threats, so I threatened to tell his sister and her fiancé. Well he got all pissed off for me threatening to report him. The last message I received from him was 2 days ago and it said “I love you but you’ve pissed me off too much this time. We’re no longer friends and I never want to talk to you again”. I cried over this message more than I’ve ever cried before. I can’t lose him, he just means too much to me. I’ve been through some extremely tough breakups (not including the one where I became a teen mom), but this was in fact the worse emotional pain that I’ve ever felt. I haven’t talked to him since I received the message but I know he’s okay cause ive been secretly messaging his sister but for different reasons so I haven’t really told her what was going on. All she knows is that we’re in a big fight and I’m concerned about him, so thankfully she’s been keeping an eye on him for me. I’m just really scared and worried about him. I know this is gonna sound cliche but he truly is my better half and I don’t know what I would do if I lost him.

I look like I am 9 even though I am going into high school next year. Guys have probably never liked me, and they probably feel like I am younger and more innocent when I’m not. My classmates and friends are always like “oh your too young,” or “one day you’ll understand.” And it’s soo annoying, I have never had a crush like me, but I’ve never told them, but it can be obvious. I do musicals at a community place, and it’s not very professional but it’s fun. We are doing Aladdin, and I like the guy who plays Aladdin. I am a narrator and I felt myself catching feelings for him him when I saw him as a lead in another show. we had a 5 hour rehearsal and we hung out a lot and played with each other and it was so fun, but then the next day we didn’t talk as much because it was stressful, shorter, and the genie was there, he wasn’t the day before. I kind of feel like I was a replacement because they are friends, and he hung out with him more. And also he said the day before that he was going to kill me. BUT he was joking and it was only because I messed with him, he is not crazy, it was a joke. And the next day he said that I probably hate him, and I was like nooo! I didn’t know what to say, so I said “well you did threaten to kill me yesterday,” I feel like he was joking but he might think that I don’t like him. And I know we won’t be able to hang out much anymore because he is mostly onstage, and next is tech week, and our show is SO behind, and everyone will be overwhelmed. Also a few months ago my friend told me that he liked one of my other friends, but I think that’s over. I like him but I never get the guy, and he probably thinks of me as a little sister, or just as friends.

But I still wasn’t over my ex. I met this other guy who made me happy. I was never as happy as I was with him. I knew we would never get married or have a future but both of our happiness was the best thing if you ever got to witness it. Months had passed and one day he stopped talking to me. I didn’t know why. I cried a lot bc he was finding ways to go through adults to get to me. I would come home crying for stuff he said to them. Well, I wasn’t completely over these two guys but I was over them enough to know the next guy wouldn’t be a rebound. The next guy was a grade younger but he was tall and really cute. Finding somebody taller than me is hard bc I’m pretty much taller than everybody. I talked to my parents about him and my dad personally knowing him and his family didn’t want me to have anything to do with him. But we talked and fell in love. But we never dated. He told me he wouldn’t cheat and he would always protect me. I heard those promises a million times. He kept all of them but the no cheating promise. I dropped him a few months ago. It took us a little while but we are friends and hangout everyday. He still flirts and our friends ask if we’re dating yet. He hestitates but I save him and say no.

At the ski retreat he told my friend that he was into me. He got my Snapchat and we started talking. He told me that I was so beautiful and an amazing person right from the beginning. He was more into me at first than I was into him. After the ski retreat we talked for about a week and a half. During that week he was so nice and constantly sending me good morning texts and saying all these very nice compliments. Then all of the sudden one day he stopped sending good morning texts and was kind of distant. I knew something was wrong and so I confronted him about it. He told me that our schedules were too busy to have a relationship with me (we go to different schools). I was sad but also okay because I was not sure if I liked him yet. For 2 weeks without talking to him I was sad and I realized that I did like him, but it was too late. Then after 2 weeks of not talking I saw him at a sporting event between our schools and we said hello but that was it. Later that night he texted me saying that he felt like things ended bad and that he wanted to start talking again. I was unsure if I could trust him. I didn’t know if he was going to leave again, but I told him I felt the same way. Then we talked every since then and recently talked about making it official and date. Then one day my friend told me that this girl that previously commented on his picture told my friend that she and him were talking. I asked him about it and he denied it saying that they talked only as friends. This brought up a conversation about dating and what we were. He told me that he wanted to date me but he was still really confused and not 100% sure what he wanted. I told him to think about it over the weekend. On the weekend, we hung out and talked about us and decided that we wanted to date. Then about 3 days after this he was distant again so I texted him. And sure enough he was basically lying the whole time and used me. He told me that he wasn’t ready to be in a relationship with me because he was still caught up on another girl. Meanwhile. This girl that he was caught up on was the reason we stoped talking the first time for 2 weeks. During those 2 weeks he had a thing with this other girl but then she dumped him... so he came crawling back to me. And he told me that when we would hang out and cuddle that he would be happy and love it but then the other girl would come into his mind. He told me that he was so happy with her and she was the girl of his dreams. (He is only freaking 16.. calm down she isn’t the girl of your dreams dude). I know that he liked me because there was something obviously there but I feel like used trash. I feel kinda dead inside and every little thing reminds me of him. I want to still be with him but I know I can never do that to myself because of how badly he hurt me. I’m just glad to have my friends and family here for me during this hard time. We haven’t talked since the breakup and I don’t think we will. It sucks though because I miss him like crazy and I just want to hug him forever. This summer we will be forced to see each other again because we are both going on another trip with our youth group. I think we will probably talk then. But I don’t know if we will talk. And I don’t even know if this has affected him at all. It would suck if he was perfectly fine and not sad at all... because I am sure sad.

The problem was that he had a girlfriend. They were on again off again, and she treated him like trash. I found myself trying to be there for him a lot, but it was hard to be supportive of the relationship when I liked him so much and she was so obviously not doing him any good. Nonetheless, I had to be, because I'm a good friend and I would never make a move on someone who's taken. Eventually, they broke up for good, and my other friends jumped at the chance to set us up. About 2 months after they broke up, him and 2 of my other friends had a sleepover at my house. We all went out to a park nearby around midnight and sat on an awning above the pond, listening to music and goofing off. He put his arms around me, and it made me feel amazing. Later that night, we all fell asleep in my living room, him and I cuddling on the couch. The next morning, he helped me make breakfast, and asked me to be his girlfriend. I was so excited, and he made me so happy. Not only had he been a great friend, but he had been proving himself to be great boyfriend material ever since he found out I liked him. He helped me cook, listened to my babbling, did the dishes without being asked despite being a guest in my house. We had the same sense of humor, liked doing a lot of the same things. After we became official, he would hang out at my house a lot and we would do homework together, watch TV, etc. One day, we sat in my room, organizing my bookshelf, and he asked me to tell him about all my favorite books. He found a picture of a dog that I used as a bookmark, and asked about her- my first best canine friend. Another time, he took the last aussie bite (a weird oatmeal snack that tastes awesome) and ran off, and I chased him all over my apartment complex until we collapsed on the ground laughing. I had an asthma attack, and he ran to my house to get my inhaler, then insisted on carrying me back home because I ""still sounded wheezy"". Once, I said I hadn't had breakfast or lunch, and he went into panic mode and started looking through my kitchen for something to feed me. I remember sitting in his lap when a friend of my brother's made some innappropriate comment and he held me closer and told the person to screw off. There were other times like this, where someone was being innappropriate, and he knew it bothered me so he would put the person in their place. A kid once straight up asked if we had had sex yet, and I made some flippant comment about making him wait, and he looked me straight in the eyes and told me that he was fine with waiting as long as I needed. Eventually though, my anxiety got in the way and I ruined everything. I pushed away the guy that looked at me like I was his whole world, that called me beautiful despite the cringey haircut I had, who loved my affinity for animals, and who never, ever pushed me to do anything I wasn't comfortable with. He ended up breaking up with me after 3 months, because I was so awful to him sometimes. I had thought I could be better for him than his previous girlfriend, but I didn't know how bad my anxiety would get, that I would hurt him too. For a long time, I was able to convince myself that I was okay with the break up. Now, two years later, I can't seem to get him off my mind. But I don't want to hurt him again- I can't try to drag him back in. It would be selfish.

Started off being friends with two girls, stopped because they were talking shit about EVERYBODY. Always complains about EVERYTHING, and even going behind my back ganging up on me because I talk to someone different from them and I knew this person for months and I only knew them for 2 weeks... all they did was tell the other about me and they talk trash.. stopped being their friend. Tried being friends with this dude, didn’t go well. He started inappropriately touching me and I told him stop countless times and he never did so stopped being friends with him.. tried being friends with this other girl she tomboyish and she has this vibe of like she doesn’t want no friends or she doesn’t want to get anyone close to her, she has this tight “lets joke 24/7 and ignore everything else” vibe. I try texting her but after two replies she never responds... try being friends with this girl that likes Kpop that goes beside my other school, she’s really smart and I talk waiting for bus and getting on bus but when I text her she never responds and some days look like she tries to avoid me. But she helped me find out I’m not actually crazy of why I stopped being friends with these people at this school, it’s just that somethings off about these people. Now “friends” with this guy and he has become distant and left me on read again and I’m just like “....I don’t believe this is how I’m suppose to be treated..I deserve so much more” and now I feel I am ended up where I began which is friendless. And idk if it’s something I’m doing or not doing.. but some how everyone else can be around everyone knowing they are talking shit about them, calling them weird, calling them names, etc, and laugh and smile and some how I can’t do that.. and it’s just like.. why am I at this school where I can’t be friends with no body.. somebody that’s just a friend.. someone who appreciate m.. doesn’t leave me on read.. explains the things their doing.. not talking trash about everything.. someone trying to uplift everyone.. someone kind and nice... someone you can just be proud of to have as a friend.. I just don’t understand.. I really don’t understands. Only good thing is my grades are a whole whole lot better. But still haven’t found the right people... maybe it was my fault in growing up..?

We were happy together even though (since my parents aren’t accepting to my sexuality) we kept it a secret. We went on a lot of dates and one day in January, we were planning a date at their house. Everything was great and going smoothly. When I had to leave I was so sad. But we texted over Instagram and such. The next day, my mother had left Me and my sister alone. I remember it vividly. I was dancing with my sister in my room when I heard a small “ding!” Signaling I had gotten an Instagram notification. I paused the music (if you’re wondering, the song was “Animals” by Maroon 5) and went to my phone, a notification from Anna. It was a paragraph and I was confused since it started with “I’m sorry i...” and I opened it. What happened the next few minutes was a blur. All I know is that Anna told me she realized she wasn’t ready for dating, which I respect. But at the time I felt lied to and a bit cheated. So I called my best friend, crying, and told her everything. (*WARNING, A BIT TRIGGERING*) Now before I go on, I have to say I’m better now and I was dealing with depression since Freshman year started. So after I hung up with my best friend, I went to my room and took a bottle of pills I had hidden in case something happened. I dumped them all on the bed and started swallowing them, not bothering to think. Anna had blocked me on Instagram at this point. I swallowed the last handful and went to my parents bathroom, taking a bottle of eye drops. I fixed myself up, coming to terms with the fact that I was gonna die. Clearly though, I didn’t die. I woke up in the middle of the night and texted someone, asking them to call 911. They didn’t. So I reluctantly got up and banged on my parents door, begging them to take me to the hospital.  I didn’t want to die. After a few hours of vomiting, crying, and panting. I was discharged from the hospital. I didn’t tell them what happened, I told them I had the flu. I spent the week in bed, vomiting everything in my stomach. I hadn’t told my parents. But they found out. I had told a friend who had a panic attack and their mom told the counselor what happened, who called my parents. Their reaction wasn’t the greatest. I’m not gonna write everything they said and did but I’ll leave a little something. My father had told me if I tried again that I should do it right. After that I spoke to the counselor (in private) and we spoke. He called my parents to recommend therapists and such. They still haven’t done anything whatsoever. But even though my life wasn’t any better after Anna left I still try to not break down to that point again. Now I’m dating a new girl who is just as great as Anna and my 15th birthday is coming up. Life is worth living. Things are going to get better. I know what it’s like to feel as though life isn’t worth it. We’re all gonna die anyways right?But thats why you shouldn’t end it so early. You should keep living. Every day is an accomplishment. It will get better. And when it does you’ll feel an immense sense of pride and feel like life truly is worth living. So just survive one more day.

So, I’m a lesbian, and this other girl (who unfortunately has my same name) was too. So for a couple months or so she was being REALLY PHYSICAL and flirty, even calling me “babe”, “sweetheart” and even “my princess”. So one day at lunch, just out of the blue, she says “hey Liv, do you wanna go to the bathroom with me?” And I’m not gonna turn her down so I comply. She takes my hand and leads me to these secret tunnels that go underneath our highschool, knowing very well that we were no longer going to the bathroom. She takes me by the waist and kisses me hard. Not gonna lie, it felt REALLY good. Relationships have never really worked out for me, so it was nice to see a step in the right direction. Fun thing is, she texts me the night after and says it was a mistake on her part, and that she’s sorry for leading me on, and that she doesn’t want me assuming we’re dating. It was a whirlwind of emotions, from feeling delighted to have been so passionately kissed to being tossed out like trash.

It scared me at first and I thought it was wrong to think that way since kids who had come out prior to when I did were always bullied about it.

This is going to be a very short story with everything turning full circle and leaving me at square one once more. This, is how I tried to come out to my mom.As a little bit of background info I’m going to tell you all that I showed many signs that I was gay before my realization, some even dating back to kindergarten. I first accepted that I liked guys when I was 14 and I identified as Bi until I was 16, when I realized that I didn’t like girls and I was just trying to be something I wasn’t. After then, I told all my friends who knew me as bi, found out some of them who weren’t bi-phobic managed to be homo-phobic, then I just left it there and moved on.It all started on one fateful Friday evening, right after I had clocked out of my job and got into my mom’s car for her to drive me home (because they don’t trust me with my license). I told my mom “Hey, can we not leave yet? I need to tell you something.” She complied and allowed me to continue. I said “This has taken a very long while for me to figure out and I want to tell you because I know that if I don’t now you may never actually find out.” Wanting to know more now, she asked “What is it?” I said “I'm gay, mom.” She started rambling on, asking the same question over and over again, getting closer and closer to the “Not okay to ask” Zone. Halfway through the car ride, she said it for the 19th time with the phrasing: “You mean you want a man to stick his penis in you?!?!” Having crossed the line of no return, I started trying to avoid telling my mom anything about my more sexual fantasies (because who wouldn’t avoid telling their parents their favorite position/known fetishes) and in the end, after saying that I wouldn’t want someone just for sex but mostly for more romantic and sensual things like cuddling while watching a tv marathon, she told me that I just want a “Super Best Friend” and that’s the last thing that was said. No words of acceptance, no calming words, nothing to clear the air or anything like that. On the bright side, at least I tried.

I told her that I had a crush on her and she proceeded to think that it was a joke because she doesn’t think it’s possible for anyone to like her. I think she’s beautiful regardless of what anyone thinks, not because of her looks. To be honest, she looks like an average queer girl (oh yeah forgot to say she’s queer too) There is absolutely nothing special about the way she looks. I really like her and whenever I look at her my heart just kind of stops beating. I want her to know she’s pretty and I tell her that often, but she shakes it off. One day I’m determined to ask her out on a date, and show her how beautiful she truly is.

At the time I labeled myself as pansexual (being to scared to admit to myself that I was a lesbian). For me, that period of time when I labeled myself as pan was just a phase, but it isn’t for everyone. Some people are pansexual and/or bisexual and they are valid. I first decided to come out to my best friend that following summer. We were on a Girl Scout trip to New Orleans and I decided I couldn’t keep it a secret anymore. We had our fun in our hotel room that we had all to ourselves, but all fun must come to an end. The light was off and we were both in our seperate beds. An awkward silence hung over the two of us, which usually never happens. I quickly turned over to where her bed was and flicked on the light. She turned back over to me with a questioning look on her face. It took me so much strength to say those two words. I had never felt so weak in my life. “I have to tell you something,” I said with a shaky voice,” I’m pansexual.” She took a second and said,” okay.” As if it were nothing! I was distraught but I kind of already knew she would take it lightly. She said that she didn’t think I was totally straight anyways. She also asked if I wanted to talk about it but I quickly turned off the light and said,”Nope.” I flipped over and we both went to bed. I truly didn’t need to talk about it at the time because I was okay with who I was. Then I had to face the fact that I didn’t like guys... but that’s a different story!

We started hanging out in his car in the back with the seats down and a bunch of blankets, we usually would just hang out but never anything else because I was really nervous. Anyways we did that a couple of times and we both wanted to kiss each other but I kept avoiding the chance because I was scared... we ended up getting nose to nose like twice but I would pull away. He then finally caught on to this and kind of leaned in and I didn’t have anywhere to go so I just went with it and I grabbed his face and kissed him. But my first kiss wasn’t just a peck, it was full out kiss with some tongue! We were naturals, we then moved onto other things involving lots of kisses, hands and my first (couple of) hickeys.... oops anyways we aren’t together anymore but I still really miss our times in the car ;)                                                                    ",191,27.68,41.71,94.07,55.37,23.88,11.52,94.76,65.97,20.42,15.18,7.33,4.71,0.00,3.14,0.00,5.24,4.71,15.71,8.38,7.85,10.47,2.09,16.23,2.62,1.57,0.00,3.14,3.66,5.76,3.66,2.09,1.57,0.00,0.52,9.42,0.00,0.52,0.00,3.66,15.71,0.52,1.57,2.62,3.66,0.52,6.81,2.62,0.00,0.00,1.05,2.62,2.62,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.57,8.90,1.57,1.05,0.52,0.52,9.95,3.14,1.05,21.47,4.19,8.90,8.90,0.00,0.52,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.57,0.00,0.52,0.00,0.00,1.05,12.57,5.76,2.62,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.52,0.00,0.00,1.57,2.09,0.00

We cuddled the whole night, talked and eventually we started making out. Things got more extreme, he asked me if I wanted to have sex. (I was a virgin at the time.) I said that I wasn’t sure if I was ready, however he pressured me into saying yes. I remember it all and it was awful. He was a good guy for the first 8 months but after I ended saying yes to sex he completely changed. He began to take 2-5 hours to reply to text messsges. He made promises and broke every single one of them. He cheated on me three times, was FaceTiming a girl out of state planning for them to meet up. It was a horrible expiernce for me.

She was pretty, sporty, and, if you haven’t guessed it, popular. I gave her a anonymous gift on Valentine’s, something I still kind of regret, because I know she’s straight. Anyways about a month, maybe less, I started liking another girl. I didn’t realize it until may because I didn’t like the fact that I liked 2 girls at the same time. She was, like the other girl, pretty, sporty, smart, and popular, but I had a feeling that she was trying to get my attention (maybe it’s just me and my very stupid mind). She talked to me more often, (maybe also hallucinating) winked at me, and at the very end of the school asked me to sign her yearbook with “I love you”. I don’t know anymore. I’m confused, puzzled, any word that is similar to “I don’t know”.

At that time, I was a child of god who was not naughty and just went along with him. Then he asked me if I would send nudes and I refused. He kept on giving me reasons why and he told me that I was hot and that he would fuck me but I still said no ....so to motivate me , he started to send me dick pics but I still said no ....he would tell me that he needed me, he only cared of me , and he liked me! After I realized that he was a psycho, o blocked him and things at school was awkward asf! He would look at me different and I would see it in his eyes too....we also had really awkward eye contact.Did he caught feelings or was he was just feeling horny?

I’m a girlfriend to what I thought was the best boyfriend in the world. Here lately I’ve been having problems with the relationship. I keep thinking that he loves me and won’t neglect me. We are a LDC (Long distance couple) He’s in New York, I’m in South Carolina. Times are hard but we’ve managed to get through them. We started our journey September 23, 2016 this September it’ll be 2 years. I know what you’re thinking, wow two years long distance there is no way. Well there is. Like I said before we’ve overcome many obstacles. Like me wanting to find love in my state and him needing space. I don’t recall us never loving each other even when we were at our lows.

Before I continue, this is not a call for help, or a plead for attention. Just thought maybe this will help someone else. When I was 16, I really liked this guy. I would do anything to be his girlfriend. I was stupid and willing for anything. He asked if I wanted to hangout at like 2 in the morning. I snuck out of the house to meet him. He drove. What girl doesn't want a guy who can drive. He took me to the middle of no where on an unused bridge. There was a gorgeous river that went underneath it. He came up and hugged me from the behind and I would feel his junk. I felt uncomfortable and said no and moved away. He again did it, I had to say it three times till he finally moved away. He went to his car and did something. I had no idea what. He then came back over to me and stood me in front of his car. He gave this look that I can never forget. It gave me a wierd feeling of fear and excitement. I didn't know how to feel about it. He started to kiss me and down my neck. The weird feeling for worse. He took my pants off after I repeatedly would say no and try to pull them back up. He kept refusing. He turned me around so I was bent over the hood of his car. I said no stop and he didn't listen. He continued to take what was not his. Afterwards he immediately said let's go. We left and he took me home. I didn't say a word. I got out of the car and walked into my house crawled under my blanket and cried. I cried every night for the next two weeks. People at school found out, he sent around pictures that I had no idea he took. A friend showed me them and I was horrified you could tell I didn't like it, it hurt, I said no. I was taken under my own will. For the next month everyone would stare at me, rumors I was pregnant , rumors I asked for it, rumors I was a slut, whore, had sex with every guy at the school. I reached my deepest depression state I was self harming suicide thoughts, I would sit there with a pill bottle and ball my eyes out. I stated smoking cigarettes, drinking, partying. I had started to lash out and hate myself. I developed anxiety, I wouldn't talk to anyone. I learned to deal with things. Again this is not a pitty party. Everything was already dealt with. I just thought it might help others and give them the courage to tell their story.

All teenagers make mistakes. I was 15 and he was 18. We were chillin at his house with all are normal friends. We all started to drink and smoke a couple blunts. That’s when I knew I had gone over my limits I just wanted to have fun and forget all the stress. But this night would bring me a lot more stress to come. I remember being a little to cross and telling them I was gonna go sleep so I went up to his room where I normally sleep and laid down. I remember him coming in and I felt his hands all over me. I said no I don’t want this. And he told me to be quiet and that I had been eyeing him all night. From that moment on it’s a blur. I woke up in different clothes and in his best friends room. When I woke up I saw his bestfriend sitting on the ground with his face buried into his hands. I rubbed my eyes and asked what’s wrong. He looked at me wit a black eye and said I’m sorry. I said what the hell happened and what are you sorry for. He found his best friend on top of me raping me. He got him off me and ended up getting into a fight with him to protect me. He told me he carried me to his room so his best friend couldn’t hurt me anymore. He stayed awake all night to make sure I was okay. He put clothes on me while I was passed out. I went to go shower and there was bruises all over my wrists and thighs. That’s when I realized what had gone on the night before. I sat it the shower crying. Not knowing how he could do this to me. His friend had to stop him. His friend took care of me. I will never thank him enough. The only thing he kept telling me was I’m sorry I should’ve followed him upstairs.

I have been in a happy and seriously committed relationship with John since the beginning of my sophomore year in highschool and I will be a senior this year. After my Junior prom I went to a small party. Only 6 people were there. We drank a lot. I don’t remember almost anything at all. Most of my knowledge is through videos I took on my phone. I trusted everyone at the party because I always drink with them. I didn’t think one of my best friends was going to drag my unconscious black out drunk self into bed and start sexually touching me. I almost lost my boyfriend who I love because of something I had no control over. Over the fact that one young man felt it was okay to take advantage of me because I was drunk. Alcohol does NOT equal consent. I did not want him in any way besides as a friend. Every friend at that party turned against me and called me a liar and said I wanted it. They say I remembered everything and I’m pretending to not know. But the truth is, I don’t remember anything about the assault. I didn’t see it and I didn’t feel anything. I didn’t feel any differently hen I woke up besides a massive hangover and I had clothes on. But he bragged about it to our friends while I was still asleep and thats how I found out about it in the first place.

The whole relationship was weird, he was really nice but we rarely talked and he was really quiet. I’m quiet too, but when I am close to someone I like to talk and step out of my comfort zone a little. I wasn’t really attracted to him either, which isn’t a good situation because the love died out quickly. This guy had never been in a relationship before, and I guess he really didn’t know how to handle things. He was super into PDA which was cute at first, but 2 minutes hugs were a little over the top, and we never kissed over our 4 month relationship. I broke it off with him after our 4 month anniversary and I can’t believe I ever went through that. He was really sweet but he made me question myself and if anyone would ever like me after him. I’ve never had a real supportive relationship and I just want it to happen already. Everyone tells me I was too good for him and that I deserved way better, but I can’t believe it because no one has every really liked me that way. It really sucks and I hope I find someone that is supportive and who talks to me.

My friend sat on the other side of the couch from me, we played with his dog for an hour, forgetting to put the actually movie on.  A bit after I noticed he started getting nervous, fidgeting, looking away. He said “I’m nauseous. I’m so nervous right now.” He gives me a nervous laugh. ""Do you want to tell me why?” I asked. He starts rambling. “I don’t want to ruin what we have.” “We’re really good friends and I like being here with you. “Guy, just spit it out,” I smile. “It can’t be that bad.” “I have a crush on a girl....and it might be you.” He starts rambling again. I grab his hand to stop him. “I like you too.” “Oh my god. Thank god.” He laughs nervously. “I was so scared.” “Me too. Oh god.” I get up to hug him, the rest I remember was a blur. All I remember is sitting in different spots. “I want to kiss you.” He holds my hand.“Then do it.”“What about your boyfriend?”“Right now it’s just us.” I smile and lean close to him. And he kissed me. It was magical. Before I knew it I was in a love triangle. The idea still makes me cringe. Why me? A couple of days later he tells me he is willing to wait for my decision.

I trust her more than anything ! I told her a little story about me and him. What happened was...during 7th period, there's was a substitute. I was sitting down and later he came in class and sat in front of me where he didn't sat. Time went by, someone who brought skittles in a jar. He saw it, so did i. We both took a handful of it and we both sat down. He put his head down on my desk, so I got one of my skittles and put it in his mouth. He got back up and ate it. Later someone told us "" are you guys dating?"" We both said ""no"" but in my head I told myself that ""I wish bro!!""

We disagree on sports and me growing up. Sometimes I begin to think that she can’t let go of me. It made me feel really angry and caged in. It’s like she wants me to stay by her all her life. I want to explore. If I explore I will grow as a better human being. I just made my own plans and developments without her. I feel like she was holding me back from spreading my wings. Don’t get me wrong, I love till death. I just really wish our complications go away. I wouldn’t say they solve it to be honest. I wouldn’t say I solved it myself either. It’s more like I balanced things out because my plans to accomplish things on my own always have a flaw. I approached the problem differently by getting around it. I didn’t want to confront my mom because that will cause bad conflict. So I search for options myself. I feel a little relaxed but I don’t like depending on others.

He is super smart and gets a lot of praise for it, which gives him this somewhat pretentious and powerful attitude. He is quite attractive which is what I like most about him. At the beginning of Summer, he told me he was going to ask out one of my other friends. She is the pretty, popular, class president type. I always feel like the off brand version of her. After he told me this, I only left more envious of her. However, after he told me he liked this girl, I still told him that I liked him because I wanted to be honest. We hung out a few times during Summer and carried on as usual. He was never the type of person to express his emotions and vulnerability to me when he was faced with a problem. At the beginning of school I was having trouble adapting so I seeked his advice and emotional support. He got angry at me... acting as if I was a hot mess and a waste of his time. He resented my ""pity party"" and brought up our conversation from the beginning of summer. He told me he would never like me back. I still kinda think he's cute and we have become friends even after he made me feel worthless. I can still tell he likes my friend but I heard she doesn't like him back.

I kinda fell hard for him. That was my mistake. We got to know each other at Youth one night when I found out that he had a date to homecoming. His date started acting shady so he cut her loose. Then he had a he that didn't care about him and a crush that didn't turn out well. All the while I still liked him. A lot Though we were just friends, he didn't exactly treat me right. I wasn't important to him and he made that VERY clear. This boy would take hours or even DAYS to respond to my texts and I wasn't a priority. That hurt! But he to this day doesn't realize that he did anything wrong. The way he lead me on and gave me hope just to crush my heart right in front of me over and over and over again, that was hell. 7 months of Hell! So I tried to get over him several times. Each time he would draw me back in. But, when he hadn't answered my texts in days AND I saw him leaving school with a girl in his passenger seat, I knew that was it. I couldn't let this guy hurt me anymore. So I deleted his number and blocked him. It's hard to ignore someone that doesn't even care enough to notice that you are ignoring them. It's kinda painful actually. I've told home 3 times before how if he's going to be be my friend he's gotta put in some work cause I don't want a half-ass friendship. Each time, he would tell me stuff like, ""you're right. It's my bad and I'll do better."" And he would, for like a day. (2 if I was lucky). I think that any normal girl would have cut him off after the first time he screwed up, but I've got such a big heart. I really cared about him and he never thinks about me. I'm still hurt, cause I still think about him all the time. He never texted me to tell me merry Christmas. But then again, none of my friends did so...? I wish things could have turned out differently. I've been battling this for 7 months and I've cut myself to make me feel better. Girls, he ain't worth the blood or the marks.

Eventually, it was tearing me apart and I kept blaming myself for things I did and just felt left out. There were times when I would hang out with either one or the other and it would feel great so I tried to keep justifying the friendship. It took 2 years and heavy depression to realize that it wasn't healthy to keep hanging on to something that was past saving. Luckily, we moved grades and they were put together in the same home room while I was on my own. At the time, I had focused so much energy on keeping them as friends, that I didn't have any others. The difference in home rooms gave me a chance to step back and I'm very thankful I found new friends who are still able to support me. This was 3 years ago. It still hurts, but it definitely got better.

She accepted and our group of friends went to the pier at night. We were eating pizza and I thought why not? I went up to her and she just said,""Yes."" Without me even asking she accepted.

She ended up being one of the most psychotic people I had ever met and made my life a living hell. I had a best friend with me throughout all of this who dealt with her as well. She would tell me to kms and that I wouldn’t be accepted into the school I am currently in and she constantly told the most elaborative lies I had ever heard to try and break me and my best friend up, then she started posting on social media about me and ended up telling her followers that I was making fun of her disability (yeah ok?). I ended up being so affected by it that I currently have a therapist because of what she believes is moderate depression, social anxiety, and mild regular anxiety.

It all started last year and at first what i was feeling i didn’t think anything of it. But i was still worried. At first it was just a little and then it got really extreme. It got to the point where everytime i went to school i threw up in the mornings. I just couldn’t stay at school. Finally i went to the doctor after missing more than a couple of days. They told me that i should just stay at school and try not to go home. I tried that and i finally made it through the school day. But that first day i finally stayed i had a panic attack. At first i didn’t know what was happening so i went to the assistant principle who i talked to before. She explained to me what was happening and she called my mom and dad. They were surprised. And then the panic attacks started to become more frequent. I have to be honest going through all of that was just torture. It was everyday that i went to school i had a panic attack. And then finally i got homebound. It was just for like 3 months. But during that time i got actual help. I got put on medicine and i went to therapy. I was starting to feel better. Second semester finally came and i had to go back. I was nervous and i actually had a reason to be. But that day i went back was rough. But the second day was much better. Then came March. This is where everything got really better. I met this boy. We talked and laughed and at first i was nervous to actually talk in person but I said the first words. He’s actually turned my life around and life hasn’t been the same since i met him. He tries to help me with my anxiety and panic attacks. I know i can count on him with anything and everything. I’m kinda afraid i’ll mess it up. But i talk to him about this stuff. And he really does listen. He’s brought nothing but happiness in my life and i’m beyond grateful. He doesn’t even understand how he has helped me. He’s really amazing and I know i don’t have to go through this alone.

I didn’t have a word for my feelings at the time (non binary) so I just sort of wrote it off as me being weird. Eventually when I became educated on more topics I decided that I was agender but I honestly am not sure anymore. I don’t think that my gender should define me so I’m just gonna see what happens. My best friend knows and I love her so much for it. I realized that I was asexual when I learned about sex and practically threw up at the thought of it several years ago. I’m not as disgusted with it now, but I know it’s not something I want to know. I am totally comfortable with that part of me and many people know, including my mom. I am not really sure where I am romantically, but I’m just going to see what happens and let my feelings figure that one out.

I was 11 years old and as i moved to a new school, i began to develop very real feelings for a girl in my science clas. I had never had a crush on anyone really especially not a girl and i didn’t think It was right. I got closer to her and she became my best friend. I never told her how i felt, until one night in 7th grade. It was her birthday and until this night i’d suppresed all these feelings in fear that they were wrong it mt parents would beat me. I was laying there with her in the floor laughing and my hand caught a touch of hers. My stomach exploded with butterflies and nerves and I felt sick. I didn’t know what to do. What it meant. I had never been exposed to anything other a man and woman being together and my parents had always told me anything else is a one way ticket to hell, but she was so soft. So sweet. And she smelt so good. How on earth could something so good be so bad ? She was making me question everything i knew and thought, but then she told me she wasn’t straight. It was hard for her and she cried and i held her i knew in that moment i never wanted to let go. I was positive, after a year of hiding and questioning and hurting myself all because of a feeling. An emotion. A sexuality. I had it easier than some, but the internal struggle of questioning an identity is something unimaginable to anyone. I told her it was okay and that it didn’t change anything and that maybe i wouldn’t be opposed to date a girl. And maybe that girl was her. And it was. for 2 years we had a beautifully painful relationship until I began questioning myself again and what i wanted                   ",332,8.46,26.35,84.57,21.16,13.83,13.25,95.78,63.55,24.70,16.27,10.84,0.30,0.00,4.82,0.30,8.43,5.42,9.64,10.54,5.72,10.84,3.01,19.58,4.22,1.81,1.51,1.81,0.90,5.42,2.41,2.71,0.60,0.30,0.60,11.45,0.60,0.60,6.33,0.30,18.07,5.12,1.51,1.51,4.52,3.01,3.92,4.22,0.00,0.30,3.31,2.71,0.90,0.60,0.60,0.60,5.42,1.81,0.90,1.20,1.51,0.90,13.25,2.41,0.30,13.55,1.20,4.82,7.53,1.51,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.60,0.30,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,10.54,6.63,1.81,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.81,0.00,0.00

We message on Snapchat daily and my intentions were to be friends with him not really anything more (he was a senior and me a sophomore) Our messages slowly got steamier and I became attracted to him but only in time for him to graduate. I felt a part of me was missing but I didn’t know what this feeling was. One day I was just talking to him and I realized I really f*cking liked him. He came back into town from college that next October to see family and we ended up hooking up during the night. I never to this day regret it amd i know I never will. He came back into town again and we met up again and made out for a while but this time I said no to sex. I decided that this time I didn’t want anything more than just kissing and guess what he said??? “Oh that’s totally cool” I was genuinely surprised he took it so cool and I’m so glad he never pressured me! That is definitely how a man should treat someone and I felt so respected. I felt totally good about it and he never made me feel bad about myself or like a whore or slut. I felt like my opinion and my own feelings meant something to him. I just said “let’s only do this(making out) this time” They responded with “ that’s totally cool, thank you for letting me know” I think this was a healthy reaction because he totally respected my body and my feelings. It was completely in my right to say no and he knew that and treated me no different. He didn’t act like I was worthless or prude or anything. We haven’t dated yet but it was still important because he learned that even though I had sex with him before, I still had boundaries and feelings.

So I was making out with my then girlfriend and we had just finished 69ing and when she got up she almost sat on my dick and then told me no sex. Personally it felt akward because I know her limits and I respect them it’s not my decision when to take someone’s inncocence and personally it feels a lot better when the girl decides on her own without any pressure. But none the less it did feel akward because here I have my girlfriend telling me no sex like I’m a little kid when she was the one that almost sat on my dick. I turned her around kissed her and repeated after her “no sex” and then reassured her that i don’t care about sex because I love her and I grateful for anything she does with me. Pretty damn good she gave me more oral and then swallowed which was amazing I think that this reaction was good in a sense that it wasn’t overly akward. She handled it well but I do wanna give my self credit because I kept my cool and didn’t go off on her for accusing me of trying to have sex It was because I want my girlfriend to feel comfortable with me when we finally have sex.

Now I know it’s normal for teens to be all in their hormones but I just wasn’t ready at that time. I also knew I didn’t want to lose my virginity to him. He kept pressuring me about it. Eventually he started asking to come over to my house and I said yes. Of course I wanted to hang out with him but he kept pressing for sex. I felt disgusted, I wondered if that’s how people saw me as someone who’s “easy”. I also felt aggravated because he wasn’t listening to me. It seemed like that’s all he cared about, not about me or my feelings. I said no multiple times. He reacted in a calm way, he said he understood and that he wishes I could trust him. So I thought okay, maybe he does understand how I feel. At first, I thought it was a healthy reaction. However, when we got back to school I realized he had been telling everyone we had sex. Even though I’d deny it. No one seemed to believe me only him. He claimed he understood some, and wanted me to be able to trust him. But I found out he was spreading rumors and tried to make himself look good. It was and is important because you matter. You are an individual with feelings, family, friends, dreams, likes and dislikes. You are important and deserve the right to say yes or no. You can make up your mind and don’t worry about what the other person might say. In my case, the result of me saying no to him showed me how low of a person he was. And for him to spread rumors, it showed me that he was in my life to try to bring me down. But that’s okay because at the end of the day i know the truth. So don’t ever feel intemidated.

So anyways we were walking and this old man out of no where says ew. I started to freak out inside so i stopped holding her hand. That same day we went to a school dance and a slow song came on and we started dancing. While we were dancing I felt uncomfortable because I thought people were judging me because I was dancing with a girl . The thing is no one knows that I’m bisexual and I feel like people are going to make fun of me because of it . So that night after the dance we went home and she texted me that she had a great time and that after the slow dance she wanted to kiss me. I replied with “I’m glad you had a great time. I’m just not ready for the whole public thing yet.” I felt awful because she wants to be a “public couple” but I’m not ready yet. I feel like that was a bad thing to do . I just want society to be okay with love . It doesn’t matter what race, gender or sexuality you are .

There was one time when we took it too far and he tied me up. We have a safety word and in this situation i did not want to say it because this was something he has wanted and i felt that if i said ""no"" then he would be angry and upset. But that's where i was wrong. Because i didnt stop him, he assumed that it was okay to do this more often. I felt so uncomfortable and it hurt, i wanted to pull away but i could not gain any control in this situation. When it was over i say up and tried my hardest to keep it together. About twenty minutes later i opened up. I said ""Justin, listen, it was okay but i cant do it like that again."" He understood and hugged me. He said ""I could kind of tell and next time, no matter what, you need to tell me when something is wrong. Okay baby?"" I just remember crying and being so happy with his response. I think his reaction was very healthy It was comforting to know he respected me like that It is important to say ""no"" in a relationship because if you never show what's too much or too far, problems will never be resolved or seen.

But I’ve had many older guys hit on me and ask for things I couldn’t give them even if I wanted to. I felt used but at the same time wanted. That destroyed me from the inside out. It made me feel like “wow maybe I am beautiful. Maybe they actually want to know ME”. It was a destructive feeling because soon after those boys usually began to make requests that made the obvious seem even more obvious. I’ve always responded with a no. I’ve always said “I thought you were different”. I never let them use me. Although this one time, this guy that I’ve known since lower school, started hitting on me. He made a request. My feelings, hopes, and desires got the best of me. I let him see the me that I wasn’t meant to show anyone at 14 years old. It made me feel disgusting at the time and it still does knowing that my still developing body was pornography for some 16 year old boy that I was in love with. Usually they always tell me “umm ok.” And stop talkin to me. Sometimes they say “you are gonna do it at some point, why not now?”. But on one rare occasion a boy said “I respect that. So what are your plans for Saturday? Wanna see a movie with me and *** ”. He didn’t make it awkward. He let it pass. He apologized in person saying how much he hates that he let his hormones take over and act like a douche in front of me. Most guys have that reaction and ask that question because their friends do. Straight boys in general tend to get easily influenced by their friends. What makes them seem ‘cooler’ or a ‘fuckboy’ appeals to them because being in a consensual relationship is the scariest thing to them. “Oh no I’m a young boy and if I get into a relationship now, I won’t ever get nudes from all these random girls”. BTW I’m not saying that ALL straight boys are like this, but in MY experience they are. Hormones and puberty confuse the fuck out of teenagers. That’s why I believe it’s important to have a close relationship with you parents especially if you feel like they can give solid advice. Personally I’ve always been able to talk to my mother or father about boys or what’s wrong and right. But the times that they couldn’t help or understand, life taught me instead of them. I believe it’s important for teens to feel confident enough to be able to say no. Sometimes they say can’t say no just because thy worry about what their friends will think or if that makes them a ‘pussy’. I believe saying no means you are strong, confident, and know how to stand up for yourself. If you don’t feel comfortable, that is already a sign that you should say no. No is okay. Saying no to such a thing as nudes will help you feel stronger in the future in case life ever throws a rock at you.

He got what he wanted so he was happy. The relationship as a whole was really unhealthy and I regret letting someone take control of me like that. It sent me into a downward spiral but I started growing up and seeing my worth. You don’t need anyone else to make you happy or to find your wealth or value. It’s important to stand your ground especially is you’re just not ready. If they can’t accept it, it may be time to rethink if that person is healthy for you.

Very healthy and smart decision Being safe at this age is definitely ideal, and not being afraid to say no is not something to be embarrassed by.

The year before she had to go to school around their because something happened to her house. So we went to hang out with some of her friends for the weekend. Their was gonna be two guys with us but one got hurt so he couldn’t come until Saturday. Me my friend and her ex/ friend went out on Friday night and all of Sunday until around 7. And we texted the other guy and asked if he was feeling better and wanted to come over. He came over .. but before that my friend was trying to get me to try and get with him and telling stuff like omg he’s so sweet and he’s so hot but he has a girlfriend.. my first instinct was to not mess around with him because usually it will never go well... well we all went out into the hot tub and we talked and everything and he was like .. realllyyyy cool and super duper hot.. but later when they had to leave we all decided that we were gonna sneak out. So me and my friend jumped out of a window and they came in their truck and picked up up.. well that night was freaking amazing like I mean hands down one of the best nights of my life... before we went back to the house we all added each other on Snapchat... the next day we started Scing and we like realized we really liked each other after about a week we kept talking for about two more mounths until his girlfriend logged into his Snapchat. She blocked me . He unblocked me. She blocked me again. Until.. he found out something I did and it was so bad I don’t honestly wanna even say it on here even though you can’t see who I am. But after about a mounth of not talking at all .. I went back with my friend because her and the other guy started daiting and I New I’d see him also... I was really kinda embarrassed and like really nervous. But apparently he wasn’t mad anymore and we cuddled and took a nap together(I NO I NO WHAT YOUR THINKING HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND NO WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT) that’s exactly what I was thinking to the whole time... but honestly I couldn’t bring myself to say no.. we both said we loved each other before his girlfriend blocked me and honestly I still fucking love him... so he unblocked me after that weekend happened and it’s been a week and I found out from my friend that the only reason he’s still daiting his girlfriend is because she has something on him.. but i don’t no if that’s because they don’t wanna hurt my feeling or it’s true and I’m honestly kinda scared to ask him.

So I asked. He said that I “made him super hard” and that he would be happy to do “whatever I wanted”. He never talks like this and we’ve only been together a month. We’re both virgins and we haven’t really talked about sex very much. I want to give him what what he wants but last night, I just don’t think I was as into it as he was. I told him I was tired and that we should wait and he was super respectful about it. He’s a good boyfriend and you should always be with someone who respects your choices and the pace you want to go at. I woke up the next morning feeling almost guilty that I wasn’t ready to take the next step. I contemplated the situational while I was in the shower getting ready for school. what was holding me back from taking the first step? Light touches ‘down there’, skimming his pants below the belt, these things just didn’t come naturally to me. I talked to some of my friends and they had some great advice. “Tell him how you’re feeling” was the first piece I really took to heart. If we were really ready to take the next step, we should be able to talk about our feelings with one another. The next, I was more hesitant about, but after some thought I decided that it was the best way to go. “Ask him for help”. If I was confused about how to treat HIS body who better to ask them him. I called him at the end of the day and Made plans for Friday night. I told him that I was worried he wouldn’t like my body or that I wouldn’t do a very good job. I explained the parts of the process I was confused about and as awkward as it was at first I think it brought us closer in the end. He was very understanding and helped me understand the process better. He wanted me to touch him there but wasn’t ready for penetration. Knowing that we here on the same page made both of us more confident and as hard as it may be sometimes to not act on impulse.. everything always goes smoother when you talk it out before hand. I think consulting friends, communicating with your partner and listening to your body are all very healthy ways of problem solving. Avoiding conflict and taking the middle path when it comes to these things is always the best choice. Listen to your partner, be kind and most of all have patience. I wasn’t ready to have that experience and knowing that I’m with someone who respects that about me, only made us closer in the end.

Some of them aren't virgins and so he doesn't want to be anymore. Only once he asked me if I wanted to go farther. This is unfortunate because I really liked this guy and wanted something with him but it's not worth it if he's just in it for Sex. I obviously said no to his request because I'm a virgin too and I'm not ready. He respected my decision but he asked me if it's okay for him to have sex with another girl just once to ""get it over with"". I'm so glad that I said no because looking back at it, I wouldn't have felt good about my decision.

Personally I’m Bi-Polar and I thought I’d share one of my stories revolving around my episodes. Back in July of 2017 I was in a pretty short, and minor depressive state, or rather I was more numb then depressed. I had been dating this guy for about a week when my episode kicked in but he thought nothing of it. He liked the idea of taking care of me and I liked the idea of having someone who was making sure I didn’t do anything stupid. Our relationship was incredibly smooth which was impressive for me because I’ve always had trouble with relationships up until that point. Sadly this story doesn’t end with him and I happily together. I eventually wound up in an incredibly extreme manic episode which led to him and I fighting a lot. In the back of my mind I felt horrible but I had no control over the words coming out of my mouth or my actions. After about a month and a half we split up which was for the best. My wonderful ex boyfriend Eventually we split up, I’d hurt him too much while in my manic state. I don’t take medication and I don’t plan to either but since splitting I’ve begun more calming exercises like meditation and it seems to be working. I began meditating after we broke up as a way to cope with my emotions I felt bad about what I had said and done but all together not that horrible. Him and I are still close friends and he continues to be a major part of my life. Since splitting up I’ve been in a relationship with someone who is also bipolar, we’re about out 5 month anniversary funnily enough. I would have calmed myself before anything serious could happen. I understand it’s not all that easy for most others suffering from bipolar disorder to cope but I urge you to try it before you start medication.

I dance competitively around 16 hours a week. So it’s really hard on my body. All the girls i dance with are stick-thin and super fit and flexible.. and i am a little heavier than everyone else. My teachers recognize that i’m a really good dancer, but i don’t feel like the girls that i dance with do b/c of my weight- which i’ve struggled with for a while. I feel as if their always judging me and talking about me. Idk if i’m right or just being a paranoid teenager. and it’s not like i can confront them or anything b/c that would ruin any little relationship we kinda have together. the girls and guys i dance with I’m still kind of figuring it out but recently i feel the situation has improved. They talk to me more and i feel that they recognize me more as a talented dancer than as a fat girl who got lucky at tryouts. It’s still a work in progress but i’ll let u know how it goes? Friends i have at church and school help support me when i need them. I feel better know that it’s staring to slowly improve. It could be better but at least their acknowledging me. I might have spoken up more during practices and inject myself into more convos with them      ",236,16.17,22.28,98.61,73.27,15.73,13.14,96.61,59.75,23.73,16.95,13.14,0.42,0.42,0.00,2.97,6.78,5.08,11.86,10.59,4.66,11.02,1.27,16.53,8.05,6.78,1.69,0.42,2.97,5.93,4.24,1.69,0.85,0.42,0.42,11.86,0.00,0.85,1.69,0.42,16.53,4.66,0.42,2.54,4.24,1.27,5.93,4.66,0.42,0.42,3.81,1.69,0.85,0.85,0.00,0.85,12.29,5.08,3.81,2.97,2.12,0.00,0.85,13.56,0.85,13.14,2.97,6.36,4.24,2.54,2.97,0.00,0.00,0.85,0.00,2.12,0.00,2.12,0.00,0.00,0.42,13.14,6.36,0.85,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.85,0.00,4.24,0.00,0.85

I feel like i can make some more of my own decisions, and I can face the consequences. They say I need to “act my age” (because I’ve matured a lot faster than my peers). I feel like they are encouraging of the fact that I am mature for my age only when it benefits them, but when I start showing signs of being independent and having different opinions than them, they don’t like it. Myself, my mom, and my dad I refused to back down from what I believe is right for myself and what I need, and I continued to explain why I want to make some more of my own decisions. Eventually, they complied with me, or at least understood a little bit. They still make minor remarks here and there, but I always stand up for myself. I talked to an older person about it, who I thought would have a gpod insight. Unfortunately, they weren’t able to see it from my point of ciew because they had different parents than I did, so we didn’t agree. I felt good knowing that I stood up for myself and tried my best to explain to them what I need, but I still felt frustrated because I felt like they didn’t fully understand. Even now, I feel like they try and push their beliefs on what is right for me onto me and worry too much about things that aren’t their business. I think I couldn’t have handled it any better than I did. I tried my best to make them trust what I was saying, but at the end of the day I’m going to have my own opinions and they will have theirs. Even if we don’t always agree, I feel better knowing that there is a lesser chance of them trying to force their beliefs on me or giving me unwanted advice.

At first I didn't even know the kid but then just this small act of kindness has made her feel good and make us friends. I thought it was crazy that such small act of kindness could make a big difference in someones life. I am not sure if imessage counts as social media but I am going to include it. One day one of my best friends and me were messaging each other just talking about school and other random stuff like that then all of the sudden the conversation got to the topic of polotics. I personally do not care for polotics whatsoever the only topics I care about are people being rude and jerks to service members or first responders/ lawenforcement. I do realize that there are a couple police officers in America that have done bad stuff but it drives me absolutely INSANE when all police officers are thrown under the bus for the actions of few. Well anyway she was talking about how awfulpolice officers were and how they were ALL racists and murderers, which of course could not be any more wrong. My dad is a police officer and I get to see first hand how truly awful his job is the mental and physical torture he goes through v eryday is INSANE and awful and all of the protesters on the street just make it worse. it is an awful thing to go to work everyday and RISK YOUR LIFE for people who hate you. and so anyway this really close friend of mine just continues to bash the police in front of my facetiming me what an awful person my dad is and with anybody else my face would be purple with rage but thiswas my very good friend and I just elt so betrayed because she knew that this was the biggest thing I believed in an dhow much it made a difference in my life. And my friend just threw our whole friendship away. We didn't talk for a while but then one day recently she tells me I should stop being so mean to her (I just didn't make andy contact by talking to her she on the other hand was full scale avoiding me she would ake unessary detours at school so she wouldn't see me in the halls. I on the facetime call was calm and my arguments were sound and she on the otherhand was sceamin) so anyways she tells me to stop being mean to her because what I said had really insulted her ( this really confused me because she insulted my family and my beliefs but I had not said anything mean to her) and that I was giving her stress ) this made me really angry and then she stopped hanging out with my friend group and has been just very mean to me lately.
