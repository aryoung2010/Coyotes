I got the courage one time to try and make plans, since he said he wanted to, but he blew me off for her and said ""he had to clean the house"" but instead his girlfriend, aka my friend posted a picture on instagram about it, and made me feel like I was being targeted by her. She knew she had something I wanted and could never have, and would rub it in my face when ever she could, always bringing him up in conversations and reading their texts off to me, even when I told her to stop and after awhile I had to hang up. When ever we had a bond, she would find a way to break it, like with watching supernatural, it was our thing, and he had no other friends who watched it, granted we both only started a couple of days ago, and she had to find her way in to our thing and be the little petty thing she is and break our bond and find a way that we all had to share it, which having to share it and being a third wheel isn't already bad enough in general. But honestly the one thing we had In common she had to break it, just to shove it in my face, that she has him, and not me. I honestly just want to cry, and curl up in a ball. I am humiliated, that I am just letting her do this, but Betrayed like every other time she runs in rubs it in my face.

But what if didn‚Äôt realize until the very end was what it was doing to me. This girl who was my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù decided to form a relationship with a guy (its always a guy huh?). Anyways my other friend and I (this was a trio friendship) started getting these weird feelings about this guy, and not the mushy gushy stuff, like we wanted our friend to drop him and run for the hills. I started getting panic attacks around him, and felt like I could breath when his name was mentioned (weird right?). Well soon enough we confronted our friend after she broke up with him (don‚Äôt do that it never goes well). She was alll nice and accepting of our criticism, but the next day she took our feelings we shared, ground them up into a much smoldering cup of coffee, and splashed them back at us. Of course she got back with the guy which ended up tearing our friendship apart because I was wary of him and warned her. After telling her about my anxiety around him, here is the grand punch line fellow humans, she suggested that I hang out with him more. Yep she wanted me to ‚Äúget over‚Äù these aniexty attacks and force myself to be happy and hang out with him. Basically she wanted me to for form a friendship with him, of course I said no because...you know self preservation, and I told her that he was he cause of the tension in our friend ship and we decided that we just were not good for each other, and split ways. So that is the story of me being pressured into a relationship (the friendship kind) with my best friends boyfriend who ended up causing our toxic friendship to become non-existing. Lol, thanks weird boyfriend for opening my eyes to his toxic this friendship was üòÇüòÇ                                                                           "

But I was at this new school and I was doing so good with my grades and everything that I knew she wouldn‚Äôt let me. About a month ago I started dating this guy. He was sweet he knew just what to say to get my full on attention. Little did he know that that‚Äôs how the last guy kept me for 10 months. So I knew the game he was playing. He would break up with me and then comeback he would threaten to break up with and so on and so on. So it got to where I was done with his crap and broke up with him myself. So I used the short little time I had to get closer to some of my friends. Well one of my friends decided to go behind my back and tell the other girl me and her ex were talking. Instead of texting me, she texted him and said she was pregnant with his child. He called me when he found out. I put the little puzzle together only too learn they haven‚Äôt been together since April, he‚Äôs still a virgin. Then the girl that went behind my back contacted him again and told him I had a bf. So of course he texted me and asked just to make sure I didn‚Äôt. So I told him no and anytime he wanted to go through my phone he could. So July 3, 2018 he went to a doctors appointment with me and my mom. Infront of him I was diagnosed with TOS (kind of a long definition, but it‚Äôs where the nerves and arteries are being compressed so it‚Äôs causing tons of pain in my shoulders and up through my neck). I told him he didn‚Äôt have to stick around. He said that he would stick around even if it meant surgery. I‚Äôm thankful I have a mature guy.

Well. His friend and I hit it off really well until the first guy decided I was what he wanted! He told me not to tell his friend and to basically just ghost him: he said not to text, call, FaceTime, Snapchat, or talk to him in any way. I didn‚Äôt know what to do because I know what it‚Äôs like to be ghosted, I didn‚Äôt want to do that to somebody.. so I asked the first guy what I should do if he messages me and he told me ‚ÄúJust ignore him. I‚Äôll tell him.‚Äù But he never would!

I‚Äôm a son to an immigrant mother living within the U.S. to help make a difference in the world. She can‚Äôt speak English, well sort of, but overall I‚Äôm her right hand man. Me and her are one and the same. She worries about me and I worry about her. I have four other siblings including two girls and two boys. I have an oldest sibling being a girl who has honestly caused a reckoning in my family. You see my mom made a hard decision when she was younger at around the age of 17-18. She decided to leave my oldest sister in Honduras knowing that the passage to America wasn‚Äôt safe. She didn‚Äôt want to jeopardize losing my sister to gangs or anything of the sort when coming to America. If most of you don‚Äôt know Honduras is a very violent country with gangs that rape and mistreat people. Police can be bribed and literally are the worst if not careful. Well, my mother was brought by my sister biological dad. Her dad mistreated my mother and my mother has overcome all the battles that came her way. Oh, and back to my mom leaving my sister. She just didn‚Äôt leave her with no one, she left her with my grandma. My grandma had a special bond with my sister because while my mom was pregnant with her so was my grandma. I know right? Crazy! But yeah, they both gave birth at the same time. Unfortunately my grandma lost her baby and my sister arrived safely. So, I guess my Grandma had a special connection with my sister. My mom left her at age 1. If you don‚Äôt already know... the one reason most people come from other countries to America; is to provide a steady flow of income to help provide food, clothing, and money to their families back home. And/or to the families they have with them in the United States.So, to all you descendants to hard working immigrant parents. I sincerely applaud your parents and you for withstanding all these challenges. I know I‚Äôm not the only one with a story and I know we can overcome it.  My moms story continues on within the years of course and literally I can write a whole book. But you maybe asking where ‚ÄúThey we‚Äôre talking about me...‚Äù topic goes into play. Well... I‚Äôve been talked about or mentioned my whole life. I‚Äôve had enemies which include friends, family, and acquaintances that have spoke badly behind my back. By calling me gay, fat, stupid, judging me by my voice, my skin tone by being brown and not white. But I overcomes all of it by focusing on school. I currently attend a Middle College so when I graduate I receive my high school diploma with also receiving a Associates in Arts. As I grew up and turned a year older since 2001. I have cried my soul out. I‚Äôve overcomed the gossip and mistreatment. I‚Äôm a Capricorn. I‚Äôve come out as bi sexual but having a strong liking into men than female. But the. I‚Äôd consider myself pansexual. I‚Äôve gotten a cartilage piercing and have change my style to where I get a diffeeent type of gossip. And I have learned to absorb the hate. I have more to tell. But for now I‚Äôd say to you guys reading this, to block out the hate and follow you‚Äôre dreams. Study what you‚Äôre going to like to work in the future. Don‚Äôt let others harm you... be a badass to where your success reflects and shuts up the haters. It can be in ways in school like getting good grades, or changing your style to what you like. Little things make a big difference.  And if you do find yourself being suffocated into a black hole. Find someone to talk too and pour your soul out, I promise you‚Äôll feel better. I know there‚Äôs a god up there in heaven that watches over us and loves everyone know matter what they classify as. He loves us. I love you. There‚Äôs always someone with you that loves you.

I didn‚Äôt like it, I mean I could stand it and it wasn‚Äôt unbearable, but I felt absolutely nothing. He said ‚Äúso I don‚Äôt know my boundaries with you‚Äù and I said ‚Äúall clothes on, that‚Äôs my only request.‚Äù He started kissing me on my neck and chest and I felt nothing at all. I said I felt sick and wanted to go home... once I got home, I knew I made a terrible mistake. I don‚Äôt even know why I let him do that, and it was just an overall terrible experience. I started to talk to other people about it, and they suggested maybe I didn‚Äôt like him or maybe he wasn‚Äôt right for me. Those suggestions did not feel right at all. Then I started thinking about the moment in my car and it all clicked. My mind was spinning from the facts that had recently been realized. I only watch the female during a kissing scene in tv shows, I asked my mom when I was like 10 if I could marry girls or if it had to be just boys. I also even fangirled over all the badass girl superheroines, instead of liking Superman and Batman and Captain America like my friends and mom did. I also didn‚Äôt like Jensen Ackles or Jared Padalecki in Supernatural, but instead loved the girl who played Charlie. After this realization, I started watching YouTube videos with gay people in them and also watching supergirl. (I know, I‚Äôm such a cliche haha.) I‚Äôve recently noticed everything my mind was scared to before. The only problem was that everyone was talking about me. How I‚Äôm such a heartbreaker and that I don‚Äôt deserve to have anyone because I‚Äôd just hurt them even more than I did with the boy.

She was pretty, fun, and I thought that she was super nice as well. I wanted to be friends with her, and I heard from the mutual friends that she wanted to be friends with me as well. We started talking and texting and sitting with each other at lunch, and we became fast friends. After about a month we were practically BEST FRIENDS. We did everything together. But then, her mean streak started to show. Every once in a while she would snap at me, or say something really harsh and uncalled for. One day, after her yelling at me about something I couldn‚Äôt control, I‚Äôd had enough. I decided I would try and talk to her about how I felt. But when I did, she completely retaliated and got really offended. We made up about a day later, but within the next couple of months this continued happening; Amelia would always say something really nasty to me or try to pick fights, and we would get into big blowups. We would make up really quickly though. I kept going back to her because she was a really fun person to have in other ways, and during the times she was nice we made so many good memories with each other. But enough was enough, and I had the sudden realization one day that she was a toxic friend and I deserved better; I was sick of constantly getting attacked and hurt by her. After about 10 months of our friendship, I broke it off. Yes I did get some backlash from her and she set out to try and ruin my life, but that just further made me understand what a true friend is; a true friend will treat you with kindness, respect, and makes you feel happy.

Like when ur crush smiles at you, you already assume he likes you. Or when he tries to help you with something like arranging a chair in a classroom, you always blush and cringe to death and assume he likes youuu. That is the case from where I came from. Sex is not a thing, really in my place. It just ends with a kiss, that‚Äôs all but it‚Äôs rare too because like what I said, it‚Äôs a conservative country. Anyhow, this just happened last year. Actually it‚Äôs not a relationship. It did not end up in a ‚Äúlove love‚Äù relationship. We wounded up being friends only. Here‚Äôs why. It was the first day of school. I rarely see him at school when I was in 7th to 9th grade because this time, I am classmate with him. The school here is different. We don‚Äôt move from room to room. Instead, we stay in a classroom and we are called a section. The teachers are the ones who move from classes to classes instead of students. So yeah. And, days passed, we were getting closer to each other. It started with facebook messenger when he was always asking me about school stuff, what are the homework, projects, tests and presentations because guysss, from where I came from, subjects are really hard and it homework are very difficult. We also had like 6 quizzes in a day. Can u believe that? Lmao. So it started with those stuff. Until eventually our conversation always ends up with asking our hobbies and interests and what do u wanna be when you grow up and whatnots. Because in person, even though we are classmates, we really dont talk that much. Butttt months passed, heee‚Äôs the one who always initiates a conversation in real life. He became impressed with my english grammars and how I think deeply of things. Now let‚Äôs go to flirting. I am not that girl who flirts so he‚Äôs the one who does that. My way of flirting is to impress guys by my intellectual functions like reading, exceeding in all school works and helping my classmates who are in trouble with their understanding of a lesson by discussing it loudly so boys could turn around and hear me explain some things the other boys may not understand it too so the probability is, some of them may approach me and ask me to explain it to them as well. Somthing like that lool. So yeah, he started flirting with me by always chatting me frequently and talks of his dreams. He wanted to be a lawyer, a soldier and an accountant at the same time and wooow dude, i think he was trying to impress me. Next thing is, he already knew i have a crush with him. I told my friend to chat him saying ‚ÄúShe has a crush on you‚Äù and told her not to tell him It came from me. So she said that. His reaction was horrible on the chat. He was like: OMG and he keeps on changing the subject. So what happened is I had a fight with my friend about that claiming I used her to gain myself a benefit smth like that. But days passed. My friend and I didnt talk but when we got back to each other, she told me that he told her something about the confession I gave. He said ‚Äúit is not that I am numb. I was just suprised. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù After that. He flirted more, he always comes near me during classes, and the most wonderful thing is he said I look so cute when I smile. No guy has ever said that to me. He‚Äôs also my first dance in Pre-prom-kind-of party (lmao). He said he is going to miss me once I go to USA. Butttt guyyss, here is a plot twist, I already knew he had fallen on someone way back 9th grade. I knew it before the first flirt happened. I was sad already but it didnt make sense because why would he be so nice to me. It also feels like he has fallen into me. This sounds corny right now but letters are not alive enough to express my emotions. Like its not just the flirts. He cared for me. But i was still confused because I already have fallen for him. But in the end he chose that someone. Even though that someone doesnt even notice his efforts. It was my first love but actually it is a failure. Now i am already here in USA. As friends, he told me he wouldnt still forget me but you know, 5 months passed, we‚Äôre already out of keeping in touch. He is already bringing that someone to malls and dining together in a restaurant. I dunno, this is boring but I was really hurt. I learned that you do not have to force it if doesnt want to turn out the way you want them to be. Some things are out of your control and you just have to accept it                                                                                       "

I never could finger it out and still I‚Äôm questioning some things. Just a few months ago I was hanging out with one of my friends, I knew she is lesbian and attractive but never thought I was sexually attracted to her. She is older so we drove to her friends appartment to hang out. We ended up, all three, wrestling each other. The other friend went to go to the bathroom but we kept wrestling, when she got over me I felt my heart race faster and all sweaty, she was looking good. In the next moment she leaned in and kissed me... and I kissed back! I was so surprised with myself and scared that when I realized what I was doing I pushed her away. We looked at each other stunned, I could tell she felt really bad but surprised I kissed back. Her friend came back and didn‚Äôt know anything happened but as I sat there I could feel my vagina had a heart beat and my ears were tingly. Later on the ride home we talked about it and although my denial I knew in my mind that was all me and I was gay. Not one other incounter with men had made me feel the same and other thoughts had begun to come together... it all made sense.

I am a guy and when puberty hit and I started developing as a female I knew something was very wrong.Estrogen is the female hormone and it is what causes chest development and curves, thinner body hair, a higher voice, a round face, mood swings, and for most people a very low sex drive. Testosterone is the male hormone and it‚Äôs what causes thick facial and body hair, a promenant jawline, a deep voice, easily agitated, and a high sex drive. Puberty and estrogen hit me like a truck. I had developed a large chest and a fragile frame. My periods kept me bed ridden from the pain they caused and it was never shorter than 10 days for me. It made me seclude myself and hide from social situations. You could say I was depressed but I see it as distressed. I came out as transgender after pushing myself to be feminine and to ‚Äúwork through it.‚Äù A bit after that I started testosterone. It honestly saved me from potentially hurting myself. I am now more confident and outgoing. Also I recently hit my 1 year mark. I have a bit of straggly facial hair, some acne, and my weight shifted from my hips to mainly my stomach. I am taking the bad with the good. I am honestly so glad that something like this exists.Keep positive everyone. Your time WILL come and you WILL thrive.

Well me current boyfriend James (he‚Äôs 18)and I have been together for 3 months. He‚Äôs currently enlisted into the United States Marines and he was just deployed overseas for 7 months, he left 2 weeks ago (on March 2nd). I realized that my period never came last month and I‚Äôm once again late this month, so I called my best friend Karen and told her what was going on. She comes over about 20 minutes later with 2 bags from CVS. She bought a ton of pregnancy tests and lots of ice cream. I took the bags from her and went into the bathroom. My other friend Kayla (she‚Äôs a teen mom) told me that it‚Äôs best to me into a cup then dip the test instead of peeing directly on the stick, that way if there‚Äôs an issue you don‚Äôt have to wait until the next time that you have to pee. I pissed in the cup and opened one of the 4 boxes of test (each box had 3 tests in them). I dipped the stick in and I set my timer. Once the timer went up I checked the tests, I pulled the first one out and it was negative, so I checked the next one and it said negative. I checked the third one and was getting ready to get rid of the cup that I just pissed in, when I saw the test said positive. I dropped the test on the ground, thankfully Karen was there so I didn‚Äôt get hurt. She told me to go ahead and try another box of tests, but I wanted to knwo final results so I opened all of the boxes. I then put my timer on and then waited. Once my timer went off I grabbed the first stick, it said negative. The second one said negative. The third one said positive. The fourth one said positive. The fifth one said positive. The sixth one said positive. The seventh one said positive. The eighth one said positive. The nineth one said positive. I looked at Karen as I thought ‚Äúhow the hell am I supposed to tell James that I‚Äôm pregnant‚Äù and then the thought cane to my mind ‚Äúwhat if he doesn‚Äôt want to be a dad‚Äù and then my final thought was ‚Äúhow the hell am I gonna be able to take care of a baby all by myself while he‚Äôs gone‚Äù.Now, we‚Äôre gonna skip 4 days. I saw my primary care doctor and she confirmed that I am 7 weeks pregnant. I had my weekly video call with James today but I knew that I would‚Äôve be able to actually tell him that I‚Äôm pregnant so I got creative and made a shirt. It was black and had the US Marines EGA symbol on it in the center. On the top it said ‚ÄúMy boyfriend is a US Marine.‚Äù and on the bottom near my stomachach, it said ‚ÄúMy daddy is a US Marine.‚Äù and it had two little baby feet under it. I sat at the computer waiting for him to call, he finally called around 6pm. He answered the phone with his usual ‚Äúhey there gorgeous‚Äù I smiled and said ‚Äúhey sexy‚Äù (it‚Äôs just something we‚Äôve said since we met).

After much research and a long path of self discovery, I decided to rebel against their ideas and follow the more unpopular path and ideology about my group, something I was more suited with. Not many people were happy with me, but another group was happy I was standing up for myself and I became an advocate at my school in a lot of ways. In my opinion it was a really healthy reaction. People were looking more of the ""unpopular"" sides opinions and try to empathize and communicate rationally, more unity was created around me. I felt proud, I was replacing my fears of following the pack with confidence and pride, whether my opinion is popular or not.

It's the very last class of the day so usually I just want to get it over with. But when after a couple months of changing seat learning people's names, and stuff I'm seated next to this guy, name T for short. I thought he was cute but I knew that I really didn't want to be in a relationship yet because I really just wanted to focus on myself. But he started noticing me too. He asked for my number and I was like sure why not like we could just be friends but no. His friends would tell me he liked me and that he thought I was beautiful and nice. I thought it was very sweet of him but like I said I didn't want to be in a committed relationship yet. As months go by in class T starts to make his move , he surprises me with flowers, food, and all these little gifts and it makes me feel bad. I tell him how I feel but apparently he doesn't get the message because the following day he buys these red roses and ask me in front of everyone. I felt so pressured. I felt anxiety just taking over my body because everyone was just telling me to say yes. I said yes. But I tried talking to him about how I wanted to focus on myself and stuff but I think the one reason why I stayed with him is because he said "" I want to be the one your with when you achieve that goal."" It kinda made me feel important to someone. It was nice and reassuring that I could mean something to someone. It was nice the first couple of months but as month 4 came along it hit me hard, he got controlling , telling me what to wear, telling me to loose weight, telling me to only talk to him. I was heartbroken. I was only in this for him. He pressured me to at least try to have sex with him but I didn't. I couldn't give it up for him. It was important to me and I just knew I would regret if I did. Eventually I broke up with him after 9 months. It took a long time to realize my self worth because I let T's words and opinion control me. Now that I'm entering senior year I've learned a lot from that experience. I have a boyfriend of and year and a half and I can say I'm truly happy with him. He knows the story and he always put effort into helping me love myself again and trusting him with my heart. Pressure is hard. Tbh and it's funny because the people who told me to be with T, eventually told me after when we broke up that I was better off without him, that I was too good for him like first off. You have no say in anything because you wanted me to, you kept pressuring me too. People just didn't understand how much it affected me. Overall I just wanted to tell incoming freshmen,sophomores, juniors , and even seniors you are in control of everything. If you feel pressured in a relationship you have the right to either say , make a change, or get out. I know it's easier said than done , and it might be sad and scary at first but trust me. You will feel all that stress come off your shoulders. Figure out to love yourself first please. You got your whole life ahead of you to find love just enjoy it like got to parties or just chill with friends. Life your life to your fucking fullest.                                                                            "

She‚Äôs the one person I trust most of all, and I love her so much, I would do anything for her. About 8 months ago I came to the realization that I felt much more for Jackie than just a love in friendship. Ever since then I‚Äôve been dealing with having a crush on her, maybe even being in love with her if that‚Äôs a possible thing to be. Of course I can never tell her, she‚Äôs beautiful and amazing and wonderful and we are so compatible but imagine if I did tell her. Scenario A. Is she doesn‚Äôt feel the same way and then things are weird- our friendship-maybe our friend group unravels and falls apart. Scenario B. She does feel the same way- but high school relationships are not forever and one day we will end up splitting and that is going to do the same thing as scenario A. The obvious answer is to shut up and find somebody else to like, but it‚Äôs not that simple. When I spend every week with her, I realize more and more who great we work together, and I realize more and more how much I need to say how I feel. So what do I do, I‚Äôve been thinking about this for 8 months and I still don‚Äôt know.                                                                              "

(4th grade)I missed a day of school, and she started telling people (that day while I was gone) that I had lice and not to hang out with me or they'll get it too. I DID NOT HAVE LICE. All throughout 4th grade ever since then I became extremely lonely and very sad. (5th grade) I got my first boyfriend, and she was jealous bc she liked him, so she started telling people that I got an STD from him. I haven't even had my first kiss yet, tf? (6th grade) She pushed me down a hill while I was on roller blades and I broke my arm. Then she ran away and I had to carry my skates home. (four blocks away from where I was) Then bc I got a bunch of ( attention) for it, she started wearing fake arm braces and faking injuries for actual attention.

Cheated on half of them, had sex under my neighbors trampoline (NOT HER PROPERTY OR THE BOYS PROPERTY), Kissed every guy she's been with on the first day of dating them, had sex with almost all of them even though not one relationship has lasted longer than two weeks.

The dares would be to ""smack my butt"" or to ""grab my boobs"". Reminder: we're in FIFTH grade. At first I though that this is just what boys do but then I realized that it isn't. Other boys in my class didn't act that way.  So after 1 month of these dares getting harsher and harsher I finally told my teacher. She stopped it but after she stopped it j still felt like I was being used. Like I was just a doll. Like I was just a part of their twisted little game.

She invited me to eat lunch with her and even gave me her pack of Oreos. Over time I realized I had feelings for her. I asked her out and she said yes. In that moment everything felt so perfect. She seemed to care about me, and I loved her more than anything. We only dated for a short time until she told me her mom wasn‚Äôt going to allow her to date until high school. We agreed to stay close and date when our freshman year came. I ended up going to the hospital and needing to leave school. We were still talking, but when I asked her if we could get together, she always said she was busy. We stopped talking as frequently, but I never stopped caring. Just yesterday, I saw she had posted a picture on instagram of her girlfriend - her NEW girlfriend who she had decided not to tell me about, and all this time I thought she still cared. As if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, her mom had commented saying they were ‚Äúcute‚Äù. She lied to me about her mom saying she couldn‚Äôt date just so she wouldn‚Äôt have to break up with me. I ended up blocking her, but i forgot to block her iMessage, so she texted me and asked why I blocked her. I lied and told her I had blocked a bunch of people just because i had too many followers. She responded saying she was actually thinking about asking me to go do something with her this week. I know that is a lie because every time i ask her if she is mad at me she answers with the same thing. I unblocked her so I could still see her Instagram if i wanted to. She said she wasn‚Äôt mad (i still was but i was pretending not to be). We said goodnight and went to sleep. I woke up today to find she had blocked me on Instagram and iMessage.

Right after first i see my boyfriend or soon to be ex. i run up to him and i said what aidan (the guy who told me he wanted to break up with me) said is it true. he quickly comes in and tries to hug me and says sorry and i left in tears. the whole day crying. can you imagine that it was like getting slapped without a warning. then the next couple days rumors start arising that i cheated on him and bunch of crap. i was so mad then a couple days later he had already asked out two girls and they both said no. weeks later one of the girls (we will call her regan for now) so regan showed me messages were my ex boyfriend (we will call him liam) liam says that he just really wanted to be with her was why he left me all this confusion rushed to my head i was trying to ignore everything. to make my life just a bit worse at this time my dad was in rehab in another country my mom had left me with my grandparents so i didn‚Äôt even have her through everything. and then the next week my aunt who had had leukemia cancer for a year died (we were very close) i didn‚Äôt even get to go to her funeral due to the fact it was far away and it meant missing theee weeks of school causing me to fail the year. and my uncle and grandpa had gotten in a really bad car crash in which my uncle (17 yo) has both legs broken (we were really close too) and i had no friends at the time to turn to. wanna know something hilarious though my 4 year bestfriend now was one of the girls liam asked out                                                                       "

One day he asked me to take him home after school and he was very persistent and I really can‚Äôt say no to people. When we got closer to his house he invited me in to meet his cat.

Many people warned me about it and I decided to ignore them. I saw the good in him. Weeks later he messaged me and asked me just to be friends. I begged and begged for him not to make that decision. After that he still continued to lead me on. He told me he missed me and wanted to hangout. Then he blocked me from everything and said I was a sweet girl and that we were just different. It honestly broke my heart. I really liked this guy. I remember seeing he blocked me and my heart dropped, and I went to my car and cried. This pain was nothing like i ever experienced before.

But my parents were accusing him of so much that he didn't do, I don't care to explain and so they took all of my electronics away and I've also had to sneak and buy a phone myself b/c it helps with my depression honestly. But he and i haven't talked since 1-3-18 and it's been the worst year of my life so far. And so I'm dealing with depression and he doesn't want to talk to me.

He has known that I‚Äôve had feelings for him for a while, yet he always seems flirty? Anytime I ask him about it he just laughs it off. Well since we‚Äôre in high school, we party a lot together and yes usually we drink a little but not enough to be full out drunk. Here recently he‚Äôs been more depressed and he‚Äôs been getting full out drunk when we go to parties. Well I asked him about it a few days ago and and he told me he‚Äôs been trying to purposely get alcohol poisoning because he wants to die. I tried to get him to talk to me about it but he just kept telling me that he wants to die and that he loves me and things like that. Well since we‚Äôre so close, I‚Äôve learned how to tell if he‚Äôs joking or not (even when texting) and he wasn‚Äôt joking. He kept making these suicidal threats, so I threatened to tell his sister and her fianc√©. Well he got all pissed off for me threatening to report him. The last message I received from him was 2 days ago and it said ‚ÄúI love you but you‚Äôve pissed me off too much this time. We‚Äôre no longer friends and I never want to talk to you again‚Äù. I cried over this message more than I‚Äôve ever cried before. I can‚Äôt lose him, he just means too much to me. I‚Äôve been through some extremely tough breakups (not including the one where I became a teen mom), but this was in fact the worse emotional pain that I‚Äôve ever felt.

All she knows is that we‚Äôre in a big fight and I‚Äôm concerned about him, so thankfully she‚Äôs been keeping an eye on him for me. I‚Äôm just really scared and worried about him. I know this is gonna sound cliche but he truly is my better half and I don‚Äôt know what I would do if I lost him.                                                                       "

I do musicals at a community place, and it‚Äôs not very professional but it‚Äôs fun. We are doing Aladdin, and I like the guy who plays Aladdin. I am a narrator and I felt myself catching feelings for him him when I saw him as a lead in another show. we had a 5 hour rehearsal and we hung out a lot and played with each other and it was so fun, but then the next day we didn‚Äôt talk as much because it was stressful, shorter, and the genie was there, he wasn‚Äôt the day before. I kind of feel like I was a replacement because they are friends, and he hung out with him more. And also he said the day before that he was going to kill me. BUT he was joking and it was only because I messed with him, he is not crazy, it was a joke. And the next day he said that I probably hate him, and I was like nooo! I didn‚Äôt know what to say, so I said ‚Äúwell you did threaten to kill me yesterday,‚Äù I feel like he was joking but he might think that I don‚Äôt like him. And I know we won‚Äôt be able to hang out much anymore because he is mostly onstage, and next is tech week, and our show is SO behind, and everyone will be overwhelmed. Also a few months ago my friend told me that he liked one of my other friends, but I think that‚Äôs over. I like him but I never get the guy, and he probably thinks of me as a little sister, or just as friends.                                                                       "

I knew we would never get married or have a future but both of our happiness was the best thing if you ever got to witness it. Months had passed and one day he stopped talking to me. I didn‚Äôt know why. I cried a lot bc he was finding ways to go through adults to get to me. I would come home crying for stuff he said to them.

I talked to my parents about him and my dad personally knowing him and his family didn‚Äôt want me to have anything to do with him. But we talked and fell in love. But we never dated. He told me he wouldn‚Äôt cheat and he would always protect me. I heard those promises a million times. He kept all of them but the no cheating promise. I dropped him a few months ago.

At the ski retreat he told my friend that he was into me. He got my Snapchat and we started talking. He told me that I was so beautiful and an amazing person right from the beginning. He was more into me at first than I was into him. After the ski retreat we talked for about a week and a half. During that week he was so nice and constantly sending me good morning texts and saying all these very nice compliments. Then all of the sudden one day he stopped sending good morning texts and was kind of distant. I knew something was wrong and so I confronted him about it. He told me that our schedules were too busy to have a relationship with me (we go to different schools). I was sad but also okay because I was not sure if I liked him yet. For 2 weeks without talking to him I was sad and I realized that I did like him, but it was too late. Then after 2 weeks of not talking I saw him at a sporting event between our schools and we said hello but that was it. Later that night he texted me saying that he felt like things ended bad and that he wanted to start talking again. I was unsure if I could trust him. I didn‚Äôt know if he was going to leave again, but I told him I felt the same way. Then we talked every since then and recently talked about making it official and date. Then one day my friend told me that this girl that previously commented on his picture told my friend that she and him were talking. I asked him about it and he denied it saying that they talked only as friends. This brought up a conversation about dating and what we were. He told me that he wanted to date me but he was still really confused and not 100% sure what he wanted. I told him to think about it over the weekend. On the weekend, we hung out and talked about us and decided that we wanted to date. Then about 3 days after this he was distant again so I texted him. And sure enough he was basically lying the whole time and used me. He told me that he wasn‚Äôt ready to be in a relationship with me because he was still caught up on another girl. Meanwhile. This girl that he was caught up on was the reason we stoped talking the first time for 2 weeks. During those 2 weeks he had a thing with this other girl but then she dumped him... so he came crawling back to me. And he told me that when we would hang out and cuddle that he would be happy and love it but then the other girl would come into his mind. He told me that he was so happy with her and she was the girl of his dreams. (He is only freaking 16.. calm down she isn‚Äôt the girl of your dreams dude). I know that he liked me because there was something obviously there but I feel like used trash. I feel kinda dead inside and every little thing reminds me of him. I want to still be with him but I know I can never do that to myself because of how badly he hurt me. I‚Äôm just glad to have my friends and family here for me during this hard time. We haven‚Äôt talked since the breakup and I don‚Äôt think we will. It sucks though because I miss him like crazy and I just want to hug him forever. This summer we will be forced to see each other again because we are both going on another trip with our youth group. I think we will probably talk then. But I don‚Äôt know if we will talk. And I don‚Äôt even know if this has affected him at all. It would suck if he was perfectly fine and not sad at all... because I am sure sad.                                                                       "
"581",58133,"","squarespace","","","","yes","","Female","",17,"","59102","","","","relationships","                                      During my Freshman year of high school, I had a crush on one of my close friends. The problem was that he had a girlfriend. They were on again off again, and she treated him like trash. I found myself trying to be there for him a lot, but it was hard to be supportive of the relationship when I liked him so much and she was so obviously not doing him any good. Nonetheless, I had to be, because I'm a good friend and I would never make a move on someone who's taken. Eventually, they broke up for good, and my other friends jumped at the chance to set us up. About 2 months after they broke up, him and 2 of my other friends had a sleepover at my house. We all went out to a park nearby around midnight and sat on an awning above the pond, listening to music and goofing off. He put his arms around me, and it made me feel amazing. Later that night, we all fell asleep in my living room, him and I cuddling on the couch. The next morning, he helped me make breakfast, and asked me to be his girlfriend. I was so excited, and he made me so happy. Not only had he been a great friend, but he had been proving himself to be great boyfriend material ever since he found out I liked him. He helped me cook, listened to my babbling, did the dishes without being asked despite being a guest in my house. We had the same sense of humor, liked doing a lot of the same things. After we became official, he would hang out at my house a lot and we would do homework together, watch TV, etc. One day, we sat in my room, organizing my bookshelf, and he asked me to tell him about all my favorite books. He found a picture of a dog that I used as a bookmark, and asked about her- my first best canine friend. Another time, he took the last aussie bite (a weird oatmeal snack that tastes awesome) and ran off, and I chased him all over my apartment complex until we collapsed on the ground laughing. I had an asthma attack, and he ran to my house to get my inhaler, then insisted on carrying me back home because I ""still sounded wheezy"". Once, I said I hadn't had breakfast or lunch, and he went into panic mode and started looking through my kitchen for something to feed me. I remember sitting in his lap when a friend of my brother's made some innappropriate comment and he held me closer and told the person to screw off. There were other times like this, where someone was being innappropriate, and he knew it bothered me so he would put the person in their place. A kid once straight up asked if we had had sex yet, and I made some flippant comment about making him wait, and he looked me straight in the eyes and told me that he was fine with waiting as long as I needed. Eventually though, my anxiety got in the way and I ruined everything. I pushed away the guy that looked at me like I was his whole world, that called me beautiful despite the cringey haircut I had, who loved my affinity for animals, and who never, ever pushed me to do anything I wasn't comfortable with. He ended up breaking up with me after 3 months, because I was so awful to him sometimes. I had thought I could be better for him than his previous girlfriend, but I didn't know how bad my anxiety would get, that I would hurt him too. For a long time, I was able to convince myself that I was okay with the break up. Now, two years later, I can't seem to get him off my mind. But I don't want to hurt him again- I can't try to drag him back in. It would be selfish.                                                                       "

The day after he ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù with me, he‚Äôd send me pictures of all these girls and it made me feel awful about myself. Like I wasn‚Äôt good enough. A couple days later I went to the hospital due to an attempt and was transferred to a pysch ward for 2 weeks. I came back and he asked where I was. I told him and he asked why. I told him the honest truth. I wish I didn‚Äôt though. Now he feels bad.                                                                       "

Always complains about EVERYTHING, and even going behind my back ganging up on me because I talk to someone different from them and I knew this person for months and I only knew them for 2 weeks... all they did was tell the other about me and they talk trash.. stopped being their friend. Tried being friends with this dude, didn‚Äôt go well. He started inappropriately touching me and I told him stop countless times and he never did so stopped being friends with him.. tried being friends with this other girl she tomboyish and she has this vibe of like she doesn‚Äôt want no friends or she doesn‚Äôt want to get anyone close to her, she has this tight ‚Äúlets joke 24/7 and ignore everything else‚Äù vibe. I try texting her but after two replies she never responds... try being friends with this girl that likes Kpop that goes beside my other school, she‚Äôs really smart and I talk waiting for bus and getting on bus but when I text her she never responds and some days look like she tries to avoid me.

Most of my exes ended up being really good friends of mine. But there are those rare cases where it ends horribly. I was dating a girl, who we will call Anna for this story. Anna was sweet, kind, and shy. She was amazing and a great friend. She knew when I was upset and knew how to deal with it. We were happy together even though (since my parents aren‚Äôt accepting to my sexuality) we kept it a secret. We went on a lot of dates and one day in January, we were planning a date at their house. Everything was great and going smoothly. When I had to leave I was so sad. But we texted over Instagram and such. The next day, my mother had left Me and my sister alone. I remember it vividly. I was dancing with my sister in my room when I heard a small ‚Äúding!‚Äù Signaling I had gotten an Instagram notification. I paused the music (if you‚Äôre wondering, the song was ‚ÄúAnimals‚Äù by Maroon 5) and went to my phone, a notification from Anna. It was a paragraph and I was confused since it started with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry i...‚Äù and I opened it. What happened the next few minutes was a blur. All I know is that Anna told me she realized she wasn‚Äôt ready for dating, which I respect. But at the time I felt lied to and a bit cheated. So I called my best friend, crying, and told her everything. (*WARNING, A BIT TRIGGERING*) Now before I go on, I have to say I‚Äôm better now and I was dealing with depression since Freshman year started. So after I hung up with my best friend, I went to my room and took a bottle of pills I had hidden in case something happened. I dumped them all on the bed and started swallowing them, not bothering to think. Anna had blocked me on Instagram at this point. I swallowed the last handful and went to my parents bathroom, taking a bottle of eye drops. I fixed myself up, coming to terms with the fact that I was gonna die. Clearly though, I didn‚Äôt die. I woke up in the middle of the night and texted someone, asking them to call 911. They didn‚Äôt. So I reluctantly got up and banged on my parents door, begging them to take me to the hospital.  I didn‚Äôt want to die. After a few hours of vomiting, crying, and panting. I was discharged from the hospital. I didn‚Äôt tell them what happened, I told them I had the flu. I spent the week in bed, vomiting everything in my stomach. I hadn‚Äôt told my parents. But they found out. I had told a friend who had a panic attack and their mom told the counselor what happened, who called my parents. Their reaction wasn‚Äôt the greatest. I‚Äôm not gonna write everything they said and did but I‚Äôll leave a little something. My father had told me if I tried again that I should do it right. After that I spoke to the counselor (in private) and we spoke. He called my parents to recommend therapists and such. They still haven‚Äôt done anything whatsoever. But even though my life wasn‚Äôt any better after Anna left I still try to not break down to that point again. Now I‚Äôm dating a new girl who is just as great as Anna and my 15th birthday is coming up. Life is worth living. Things are going to get better. I know what it‚Äôs like to feel as though life isn‚Äôt worth it. We‚Äôre all gonna die anyways right?But thats why you shouldn‚Äôt end it so early. You should keep living. Every day is an accomplishment. It will get better. And when it does you‚Äôll feel an immense sense of pride and feel like life truly is worth living. So just survive one more day.                                                                       "

This is going to be a very short story with everything turning full circle and leaving me at square one once more. This, is how I tried to come out to my mom.As a little bit of background info I‚Äôm going to tell you all that I showed many signs that I was gay before my realization, some even dating back to kindergarten. I first accepted that I liked guys when I was 14 and I identified as Bi until I was 16, when I realized that I didn‚Äôt like girls and I was just trying to be something I wasn‚Äôt. After then, I told all my friends who knew me as bi, found out some of them who weren‚Äôt bi-phobic managed to be homo-phobic, then I just left it there and moved on.It all started on one fateful Friday evening, right after I had clocked out of my job and got into my mom‚Äôs car for her to drive me home (because they don‚Äôt trust me with my license). I told my mom ‚ÄúHey, can we not leave yet? I need to tell you something.‚Äù She complied and allowed me to continue. I said ‚ÄúThis has taken a very long while for me to figure out and I want to tell you because I know that if I don‚Äôt now you may never actually find out.‚Äù Wanting to know more now, she asked ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI'm gay, mom.‚Äù She started rambling on, asking the same question over and over again, getting closer and closer to the ‚ÄúNot okay to ask‚Äù Zone. Halfway through the car ride, she said it for the 19th time with the phrasing: ‚ÄúYou mean you want a man to stick his penis in you?!?!‚Äù Having crossed the line of no return, I started trying to avoid telling my mom anything about my more sexual fantasies (because who wouldn‚Äôt avoid telling their parents their favorite position/known fetishes) and in the end, after saying that I wouldn‚Äôt want someone just for sex but mostly for more romantic and sensual things like cuddling while watching a tv marathon, she told me that I just want a ‚ÄúSuper Best Friend‚Äù and that‚Äôs the last thing that was said. No words of acceptance, no calming words, nothing to clear the air or anything like that. On the bright side, at least I tried.                                                                      "

At the time I labeled myself as pansexual (being to scared to admit to myself that I was a lesbian). For me, that period of time when I labeled myself as pan was just a phase, but it isn‚Äôt for everyone. Some people are pansexual and/or bisexual and they are valid. I first decided to come out to my best friend that following summer. We were on a Girl Scout trip to New Orleans and I decided I couldn‚Äôt keep it a secret anymore. We had our fun in our hotel room that we had all to ourselves, but all fun must come to an end. The light was off and we were both in our seperate beds. An awkward silence hung over the two of us, which usually never happens. I quickly turned over to where her bed was and flicked on the light. She turned back over to me with a questioning look on her face. It took me so much strength to say those two words. I had never felt so weak in my life. ‚ÄúI have to tell you something,‚Äù I said with a shaky voice,‚Äù I‚Äôm pansexual.‚Äù She took a second and said,‚Äù okay.‚Äù As if it were nothing! I was distraught but I kind of already knew she would take it lightly. She said that she didn‚Äôt think I was totally straight anyways. She also asked if I wanted to talk about it but I quickly turned off the light and said,‚ÄùNope.‚Äù I flipped over and we both went to bed. I truly didn‚Äôt need to talk about it at the time because I was okay with who I was. Then I had to face the fact that I didn‚Äôt like guys... but that‚Äôs a different story!                                                                      "

We started hanging out in his car in the back with the seats down and a bunch of blankets, we usually would just hang out but never anything else because I was really nervous. Anyways we did that a couple of times and we both wanted to kiss each other but I kept avoiding the chance because I was scared... we ended up getting nose to nose like twice but I would pull away. He then finally caught on to this and kind of leaned in and I didn‚Äôt have anywhere to go so I just went with it and I grabbed his face and kissed him. But my first kiss wasn‚Äôt just a peck, it was full out kiss with some tongue! We were naturals, we then moved onto other things involving lots of kisses, hands and my first (couple of) hickeys.... oops anyways we aren‚Äôt together anymore but I still really miss our times in the car ;)                                                                    "

Like I said before we‚Äôve overcome many obstacles. Like me wanting to find love in my state and him needing space. I don‚Äôt recall us never loving each other even when we were at our lows. My problem is that my boyfriend is failing to call me or communicate in general. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm no longer important to him.

Before I continue, this is not a call for help, or a plead for attention. Just thought maybe this will help someone else. When I was 16, I really liked this guy. I would do anything to be his girlfriend. I was stupid and willing for anything. He asked if I wanted to hangout at like 2 in the morning. I snuck out of the house to meet him. He drove. What girl doesn't want a guy who can drive. He took me to the middle of no where on an unused bridge. There was a gorgeous river that went underneath it. He came up and hugged me from the behind and I would feel his junk. I felt uncomfortable and said no and moved away. He again did it, I had to say it three times till he finally moved away. He went to his car and did something. I had no idea what. He then came back over to me and stood me in front of his car. He gave this look that I can never forget. It gave me a wierd feeling of fear and excitement. I didn't know how to feel about it. He started to kiss me and down my neck. The weird feeling for worse. He took my pants off after I repeatedly would say no and try to pull them back up. He kept refusing. He turned me around so I was bent over the hood of his car. I said no stop and he didn't listen. He continued to take what was not his. Afterwards he immediately said let's go. We left and he took me home. I didn't say a word. I got out of the car and walked into my house crawled under my blanket and cried. I cried every night for the next two weeks. People at school found out, he sent around pictures that I had no idea he took. A friend showed me them and I was horrified you could tell I didn't like it, it hurt, I said no. I was taken under my own will. For the next month everyone would stare at me, rumors I was pregnant , rumors I asked for it, rumors I was a slut, whore, had sex with every guy at the school. I reached my deepest depression state I was self harming suicide thoughts, I would sit there with a pill bottle and ball my eyes out. I stated smoking cigarettes, drinking, partying. I had started to lash out and hate myself. I developed anxiety, I wouldn't talk to anyone. I learned to deal with things. Again this is not a pitty party. Everything was already dealt with. I just thought it might help others and give them the courage to tell their story.                                                                 "

That‚Äôs when I knew I had gone over my limits I just wanted to have fun and forget all the stress. But this night would bring me a lot more stress to come. I remember being a little to cross and telling them I was gonna go sleep so I went up to his room where I normally sleep and laid down. I remember him coming in and I felt his hands all over me. I said no I don‚Äôt want this. And he told me to be quiet and that I had been eyeing him all night. From that moment on it‚Äôs a blur. I woke up in different clothes and in his best friends room. When I woke up I saw his bestfriend sitting on the ground with his face buried into his hands. I rubbed my eyes and asked what‚Äôs wrong. He looked at me wit a black eye and said I‚Äôm sorry. I said what the hell happened and what are you sorry for. He found his best friend on top of me raping me. He got him off me and ended up getting into a fight with him to protect me. He told me he carried me to his room so his best friend couldn‚Äôt hurt me anymore. He stayed awake all night to make sure I was okay. He put clothes on me while I was passed out. I went to go shower and there was bruises all over my wrists and thighs. That‚Äôs when I realized what had gone on the night before. I sat it the shower crying. Not knowing how he could do this to me. His friend had to stop him. His friend took care of me. I will never thank him enough.

After my Junior prom I went to a small party. Only 6 people were there. We drank a lot. I don‚Äôt remember almost anything at all. Most of my knowledge is through videos I took on my phone.

I feel like she was holding me back from spreading my wings. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love till death. I just really wish our complications go away. I wouldn‚Äôt say they solve it to be honest. I wouldn‚Äôt say I solved it myself either. It‚Äôs more like I balanced things out because my plans to accomplish things on my own always have a flaw. I approached the problem differently by getting around it. I didn‚Äôt want to confront my mom because that will cause bad conflict. So I search for options myself.

I always feel like the off brand version of her. After he told me this, I only left more envious of her. However, after he told me he liked this girl, I still told him that I liked him because I wanted to be honest. We hung out a few times during Summer and carried on as usual. He was never the type of person to express his emotions and vulnerability to me when he was faced with a problem. At the beginning of school I was having trouble adapting so I seeked his advice and emotional support. He got angry at me... acting as if I was a hot mess and a waste of his time. He resented my ""pity party"" and brought up our conversation from the beginning of summer. He told me he would never like me back. I still kinda think he's cute and we have become friends even after he made me feel worthless. I can still tell he likes my friend but I heard she doesn't like him back.

I kinda fell hard for him. That was my mistake. We got to know each other at Youth one night when I found out that he had a date to homecoming. His date started acting shady so he cut her loose. Then he had a he that didn't care about him and a crush that didn't turn out well. All the while I still liked him. A lot Though we were just friends, he didn't exactly treat me right. I wasn't important to him and he made that VERY clear. This boy would take hours or even DAYS to respond to my texts and I wasn't a priority. That hurt! But he to this day doesn't realize that he did anything wrong. The way he lead me on and gave me hope just to crush my heart right in front of me over and over and over again, that was hell. 7 months of Hell! So I tried to get over him several times. Each time he would draw me back in. But, when he hadn't answered my texts in days AND I saw him leaving school with a girl in his passenger seat, I knew that was it. I couldn't let this guy hurt me anymore. So I deleted his number and blocked him. It's hard to ignore someone that doesn't even care enough to notice that you are ignoring them. It's kinda painful actually. I've told home 3 times before how if he's going to be be my friend he's gotta put in some work cause I don't want a half-ass friendship. Each time, he would tell me stuff like, ""you're right. It's my bad and I'll do better."" And he would, for like a day. (2 if I was lucky). I think that any normal girl would have cut him off after the first time he screwed up, but I've got such a big heart. I really cared about him and he never thinks about me. I'm still hurt, cause I still think about him all the time. He never texted me to tell me merry Christmas. But then again, none of my friends did so...üòì I wish things could have turned out differently. I've been battling this for 7 months and I've cut myself to make me feel better. Girls, he ain't worth the blood or the marks.                                        "

Eventually, it was tearing me apart and I kept blaming myself for things I did and just felt left out. There were times when I would hang out with either one or the other and it would feel great so I tried to keep justifying the friendship. It took 2 years and heavy depression to realize that it wasn't healthy to keep hanging on to something that was past saving. Luckily, we moved grades and they were put together in the same home room while I was on my own. At the time, I had focused so much energy on keeping them as friends, that I didn't have any others. The difference in home rooms gave me a chance to step back and I'm very thankful I found new friends who are still able to support me. This was 3 years ago. It still hurts, but it definitely got better. To be a third wheel                             "

I thought that there is no way that there isn't a least something between us. That weekend I asked her on Snapchat is she wanted to hang out at the pier at the beach. She accepted and our group of friends went to the pier at night. We were eating pizza and I thought why not? I went up to her and she just said,""Yes."" Without me even asking she accepted. Later, I figured out that her best friend wanted to hook up with me and lied that her friend didn't like me. I'm happy I asked her it was a fun relationship and she was a great girl. Now I have the confidence to just ask a girl out without finding out if she likes me. Why not?                             "

It all started last year and at first what i was feeling i didn‚Äôt think anything of it. But i was still worried. At first it was just a little and then it got really extreme. It got to the point where everytime i went to school i threw up in the mornings. I just couldn‚Äôt stay at school. Finally i went to the doctor after missing more than a couple of days. They told me that i should just stay at school and try not to go home. I tried that and i finally made it through the school day. But that first day i finally stayed i had a panic attack. At first i didn‚Äôt know what was happening so i went to the assistant principle who i talked to before. She explained to me what was happening and she called my mom and dad. They were surprised. And then the panic attacks started to become more frequent. I have to be honest going through all of that was just torture. It was everyday that i went to school i had a panic attack. And then finally i got homebound. It was just for like 3 months. But during that time i got actual help. I got put on medicine and i went to therapy. I was starting to feel better. Second semester finally came and i had to go back. I was nervous and i actually had a reason to be. But that day i went back was rough. But the second day was much better. Then came March. This is where everything got really better. I met this boy. We talked and laughed and at first i was nervous to actually talk in person but I said the first words. He‚Äôs actually turned my life around and life hasn‚Äôt been the same since i met him. He tries to help me with my anxiety and panic attacks. I know i can count on him with anything and everything.

I was 11 years old and as i moved to a new school, i began to develop very real feelings for a girl in my science clas. I had never had a crush on anyone really especially not a girl and i didn‚Äôt think It was right. I got closer to her and she became my best friend. I never told her how i felt, until one night in 7th grade. It was her birthday and until this night i‚Äôd suppresed all these feelings in fear that they were wrong it mt parents would beat me. I was laying there with her in the floor laughing and my hand caught a touch of hers. My stomach exploded with butterflies and nerves and I felt sick. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. What it meant. I had never been exposed to anything other a man and woman being together and my parents had always told me anything else is a one way ticket to hell, but she was so soft. So sweet. And she smelt so good. How on earth could something so good be so bad ? She was making me question everything i knew and thought, but then she told me she wasn‚Äôt straight. It was hard for her and she cried and i held her i knew in that moment i never wanted to let go. I was positive, after a year of hiding and questioning and hurting myself all because of a feeling. An emotion. A sexuality. I had it easier than some, but the internal struggle of questioning an identity is something unimaginable to anyone. I told her it was okay and that it didn‚Äôt change anything and that maybe i wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to date a girl. And maybe that girl was her. And it was. for 2 years we had a beautifully painful relationship until I began questioning myself again and what i wanted                   "

We message on Snapchat daily and my intentions were to be friends with him not really anything more (he was a senior and me a sophomore) Our messages slowly got steamier and I became attracted to him but only in time for him to graduate. I felt a part of me was missing but I didn‚Äôt know what this feeling was. One day I was just talking to him and I realized I really f*cking liked him. He came back into town from college that next October to see family and we ended up hooking up during the night. I never to this day regret it amd i know I never will. He came back into town again and we met up again and made out for a while but this time I said no to sex. I decided that this time I didn‚Äôt want anything more than just kissing and guess what he said??? ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs totally cool‚Äù I was genuinely surprised he took it so cool and I‚Äôm so glad he never pressured me! That is definitely how a man should treat someone and I felt so respected. I felt totally good about it and he never made me feel bad about myself or like a whore or slut. I felt like my opinion and my own feelings meant something to him. I just said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs only do this(making out) this time‚Äù They responded with ‚Äú that‚Äôs totally cool, thank you for letting me know‚Äù I think this was a healthy reaction because he totally respected my body and my feelings. It was completely in my right to say no and he knew that and treated me no different. He didn‚Äôt act like I was worthless or prude or anything. We haven‚Äôt dated yet but it was still important because he learned that even though I had sex with him before, I still had boundaries and feelings.            "

Personally it felt akward because I know her limits and I respect them it‚Äôs not my decision when to take someone‚Äôs inncocence and personally it feels a lot better when the girl decides on her own without any pressure. But none the less it did feel akward because here I have my girlfriend telling me no sex like I‚Äôm a little kid when she was the one that almost sat on my dick. I turned her around kissed her and repeated after her ‚Äúno sex‚Äù and then reassured her that i don‚Äôt care about sex because I love her and I grateful for anything she does with me. Pretty damn good she gave me more oral and then swallowed which was amazing I think that this reaction was good in a sense that it wasn‚Äôt overly akward. She handled it well but I do wanna give my self credit because I kept my cool and didn‚Äôt go off on her for accusing me of trying to have sex It was because I want my girlfriend to feel comfortable with me when we finally have sex.

Eventually he started asking to come over to my house and I said yes. Of course I wanted to hang out with him but he kept pressing for sex. I felt disgusted, I wondered if that‚Äôs how people saw me as someone who‚Äôs ‚Äúeasy‚Äù. I also felt aggravated because he wasn‚Äôt listening to me. It seemed like that‚Äôs all he cared about, not about me or my feelings. I said no multiple times. He reacted in a calm way, he said he understood and that he wishes I could trust him. So I thought okay, maybe he does understand how I feel. At first, I thought it was a healthy reaction. However, when we got back to school I realized he had been telling everyone we had sex. Even though I‚Äôd deny it. No one seemed to believe me only him. He claimed he understood some, and wanted me to be able to trust him. But I found out he was spreading rumors and tried to make himself look good. It was and is important because you matter. You are an individual with feelings, family, friends, dreams, likes and dislikes. You are important and deserve the right to say yes or no. You can make up your mind and don‚Äôt worry about what the other person might say. In my case, the result of me saying no to him showed me how low of a person he was. And for him to spread rumors, it showed me that he was in my life to try to bring me down. But that‚Äôs okay because at the end of the day i know the truth. So don‚Äôt ever feel intemidated.            "

It made me feel like ‚Äúwow maybe I am beautiful. Maybe they actually want to know ME‚Äù. It was a destructive feeling because soon after those boys usually began to make requests that made the obvious seem even more obvious. I‚Äôve always responded with a no. I‚Äôve always said ‚ÄúI thought you were different‚Äù. I never let them use me. Although this one time, this guy that I‚Äôve known since lower school, started hitting on me. He made a request. My feelings, hopes, and desires got the best of me. I let him see the me that I wasn‚Äôt meant to show anyone at 14 years old. It made me feel disgusting at the time and it still does knowing that my still developing body was pornography for some 16 year old boy that I was in love with. Usually they always tell me ‚Äúumm ok.‚Äù And stop talkin to me. Sometimes they say ‚Äúyou are gonna do it at some point, why not now?‚Äù. But on one rare occasion a boy said ‚ÄúI respect that. So what are your plans for Saturday? Wanna see a movie with me and *** ‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt make it awkward. He let it pass. He apologized in person saying how much he hates that he let his hormones take over and act like a douche in front of me. Most guys have that reaction and ask that question because their friends do. Straight boys in general tend to get easily influenced by their friends. What makes them seem ‚Äòcooler‚Äô or a ‚Äòfuckboy‚Äô appeals to them because being in a consensual relationship is the scariest thing to them. ‚ÄúOh no I‚Äôm a young boy and if I get into a relationship now, I won‚Äôt ever get nudes from all these random girls‚Äù. BTW I‚Äôm not saying that ALL straight boys are like this, but in MY experience they are. Hormones and puberty confuse the fuck out of teenagers. That‚Äôs why I believe it‚Äôs important to have a close relationship with you parents especially if you feel like they can give solid advice. Personally I‚Äôve always been able to talk to my mother or father about boys or what‚Äôs wrong and right. But the times that they couldn‚Äôt help or understand, life taught me instead of them. I believe it‚Äôs important for teens to feel confident enough to be able to say no. Sometimes they say can‚Äôt say no just because thy worry about what their friends will think or if that makes them a ‚Äòpussy‚Äô. I believe saying no means you are strong, confident, and know how to stand up for yourself. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable, that is already a sign that you should say no. No is okay. Saying no to such a thing as nudes will help you feel stronger in the future in case life ever throws a rock at you.            "

He got what he wanted so he was happy. The relationship as a whole was really unhealthy and I regret letting someone take control of me like that. It sent me into a downward spiral but I started growing up and seeing my worth. You don‚Äôt need anyone else to make you happy or to find your wealth or value. It‚Äôs important to stand your ground especially is you‚Äôre just not ready. If they can‚Äôt accept it, it may be time to rethink if that person is healthy for you.            "

Very healthy and smart decision Being safe at this age is definitely ideal, and not being afraid to say no is not something to be embarrassed by.

The year before she had to go to school around their because something happened to her house. So we went to hang out with some of her friends for the weekend. Their was gonna be two guys with us but one got hurt so he couldn‚Äôt come until Saturday. Me my friend and her ex/ friend went out on Friday night and all of Sunday until around 7. And we texted the other guy and asked if he was feeling better and wanted to come over. He came over .. but before that my friend was trying to get me to try and get with him and telling stuff like omg he‚Äôs so sweet and he‚Äôs so hot but he has a girlfriend.. my first instinct was to not mess around with him because usually it will never go well... well we all went out into the hot tub and we talked and everything and he was like .. realllyyyy cool and super duper hot.. but later when they had to leave we all decided that we were gonna sneak out. So me and my friend jumped out of a window and they came in their truck and picked up up.. well that night was freaking amazing like I mean hands down one of the best nights of my life... before we went back to the house we all added each other on Snapchat... the next day we started Scing and we like realized we really liked each other after about a week we kept talking for about two more mounths until his girlfriend logged into his Snapchat. She blocked me . He unblocked me. She blocked me again. Until.. he found out something I did and it was so bad I don‚Äôt honestly wanna even say it on here even though you can‚Äôt see who I am. But after about a mounth of not talking at all .. I went back with my friend because her and the other guy started daiting and I New I‚Äôd see him also... I was really kinda embarrassed and like really nervous. But apparently he wasn‚Äôt mad anymore and we cuddled and took a nap together(I NO I NO WHAT YOUR THINKING HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND NO WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT) that‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking to the whole time... but honestly I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to say no.. we both said we loved each other before his girlfriend blocked me and honestly I still fucking love him... so he unblocked me after that weekend happened and it‚Äôs been a week and I found out from my friend that the only reason he‚Äôs still daiting his girlfriend is because she has something on him.. but i don‚Äôt no if that‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt wanna hurt my feeling or it‚Äôs true and I‚Äôm honestly kinda scared to ask him. Confused... very confused ... Depends on which one but.. Both I don‚Äôt no what to do Idk that‚Äôs what I need help with I need to no if I should STOP or keep going until he does break up with her because I have already told him that I‚Äôm not gonna wait much longer .. my friend told me he tried to break up with her and she started crying and threw a tantrum and she said no but I don‚Äôt no ...I NEED HELPPPP            "

So I asked. He said that I ‚Äúmade him super hard‚Äù and that he would be happy to do ‚Äúwhatever I wanted‚Äù. He never talks like this and we‚Äôve only been together a month. We‚Äôre both virgins and we haven‚Äôt really talked about sex very much. I want to give him what what he wants but last night, I just don‚Äôt think I was as into it as he was. I told him I was tired and that we should wait and he was super respectful about it. He‚Äôs a good boyfriend and you should always be with someone who respects your choices and the pace you want to go at. I woke up the next morning feeling almost guilty that I wasn‚Äôt ready to take the next step. I contemplated the situational while I was in the shower getting ready for school. what was holding me back from taking the first step? Light touches ‚Äòdown there‚Äô, skimming his pants below the belt, these things just didn‚Äôt come naturally to me. I talked to some of my friends and they had some great advice. ‚ÄúTell him how you‚Äôre feeling‚Äù was the first piece I really took to heart. If we were really ready to take the next step, we should be able to talk about our feelings with one another. The next, I was more hesitant about, but after some thought I decided that it was the best way to go. ‚ÄúAsk him for help‚Äù. If I was confused about how to treat HIS body who better to ask them him. I called him at the end of the day and Made plans for Friday night. I told him that I was worried he wouldn‚Äôt like my body or that I wouldn‚Äôt do a very good job. I explained the parts of the process I was confused about and as awkward as it was at first I think it brought us closer in the end. He was very understanding and helped me understand the process better. He wanted me to touch him there but wasn‚Äôt ready for penetration. Knowing that we here on the same page made both of us more confident and as hard as it may be sometimes to not act on impulse.. everything always goes smoother when you talk it out before hand. I think consulting friends, communicating with your partner and listening to your body are all very healthy ways of problem solving. Avoiding conflict and taking the middle path when it comes to these things is always the best choice. Listen to your partner, be kind and most of all have patience. I wasn‚Äôt ready to have that experience and knowing that I‚Äôm with someone who respects that about me, only made us closer in the end.            "

Some of them aren't virgins and so he doesn't want to be anymore. Only once he asked me if I wanted to go farther. This is unfortunate because I really liked this guy and wanted something with him but it's not worth it if he's just in it for Sex. I obviously said no to his request because I'm a virgin too and I'm not ready. He respected my decision but he asked me if it's okay for him to have sex with another girl just once to ""get it over with"". I'm so glad that I said no because looking back at it, I wouldn't have felt good about my decision.

Personally I‚Äôm Bi-Polar and I thought I‚Äôd share one of my stories revolving around my episodes. Back in July of 2017 I was in a pretty short, and minor depressive state, or rather I was more numb then depressed. I had been dating this guy for about a week when my episode kicked in but he thought nothing of it. He liked the idea of taking care of me and I liked the idea of having someone who was making sure I didn‚Äôt do anything stupid. Our relationship was incredibly smooth which was impressive for me because I‚Äôve always had trouble with relationships up until that point. Sadly this story doesn‚Äôt end with him and I happily together. I eventually wound up in an incredibly extreme manic episode which led to him and I fighting a lot. In the back of my mind I felt horrible but I had no control over the words coming out of my mouth or my actions. After about a month and a half we split up which was for the best. My wonderful ex boyfriend Eventually we split up, I‚Äôd hurt him too much while in my manic state. I don‚Äôt take medication and I don‚Äôt plan to either but since splitting I‚Äôve begun more calming exercises like meditation and it seems to be working. I began meditating after we broke up as a way to cope with my emotions I felt bad about what I had said and done but all together not that horrible. Him and I are still close friends and he continues to be a major part of my life. Since splitting up I‚Äôve been in a relationship with someone who is also bipolar, we‚Äôre about out 5 month anniversary funnily enough. I would have calmed myself before anything serious could happen. I understand it‚Äôs not all that easy for most others suffering from bipolar disorder to cope but I urge you to try it before you start medication.      "

I talked to an older person about it, who I thought would have a gpod insight.

I was able to talk to her and catch up using instagram and other apps. We were a lot closer and though this happened a year ago we are still great friends. I feel great being able to still talk to her and that we are still friends One of my friends was posting some hurtful things and I couldn't really do anything to make her stop. I felt terrible when I saw what she posted. Knowing that all my friends were able to see. I learned that a lot can happen in social media and not all of it is good."

It helped people share events and keep each other updated on things like homework. At first, nothing. Over time, people from my grade received notice of it, and started to post replace the subjects. I felt proud that I had actually done something to help connect people, as I am usually not very social. Some of the girls in my class got into a disagreement, and social media was involved, I was never sure exactly what happened, but I still felt bad. Lousy, it felt like I should have been able to do something to help them. Social media isn't always a good thing."

Well... I was at a friends house and then some old friends prank called me and when I didn't answer they just kept calling and calling and at that time I didn't know it was them so eventually I picked up and they were saying all kind of weird things about like how my mom wanted me home and this was at about midnight so I was already freaked out for getting an unknown call I felt terrified at first then when I found out that it was some friends I was pretty upset but then I told them how I felt and that I was just really worried about my mom and to please not do that again.

At first I didn't even know the kid but then just this small act of kindness has made her feel good and make us friends. I thought it was crazy that such small act of kindness could make a big difference in someones life. I am not sure if imessage counts as social media but I am going to include it. One day one of my best friends and me were messaging each other just talking about school and other random stuff like that then all of the sudden the conversation got to the topic of polotics. I personally do not care for polotics whatsoever the only topics I care about are people being rude and jerks to service members or first responders/ lawenforcement. I do realize that there are a couple police officers in America that have done bad stuff but it drives me absolutely INSANE when all police officers are thrown under the bus for the actions of few. Well anyway she was talking about how awfulpolice officers were and how they were ALL racists and murderers, which of course could not be any more wrong. My dad is a police officer and I get to see first hand how truly awful his job is the mental and physical torture he goes through v eryday is INSANE and awful and all of the protesters on the street just make it worse. it is an awful thing to go to work everyday and RISK YOUR LIFE for people who hate you. and so anyway this really close friend of mine just continues to bash the police in front of my facetiming me what an awful person my dad is and with anybody else my face would be purple with rage but thiswas my very good friend and I just elt so betrayed because she knew that this was the biggest thing I believed in an dhow much it made a difference in my life. And my friend just threw our whole friendship away. We didn't talk for a while but then one day recently she tells me I should stop being so mean to her (I just didn't make andy contact by talking to her she on the other hand was full scale avoiding me she would ake unessary detours at school so she wouldn't see me in the halls. I on the facetime call was calm and my arguments were sound and she on the otherhand was sceamin) so anyways she tells me to stop being mean to her because what I said had really insulted her ( this really confused me because she insulted my family and my beliefs but I had not said anything mean to her) and that I was giving her stress ) this made me really angry and then she stopped hanging out with my friend group and has been just very mean to me lately. This jurt a lot because my own friend who I trusted carfully crafted the words the she knew would hurt me the most and said them to me in a very rude manner. I learned that in life not everone is going to agree with you but you should stick to your beliefs"
